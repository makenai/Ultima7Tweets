"To be called ruler of gargoyles. To respond to Zhelkas. To mean `Iron Helm.'"
"I am sorry, but thou hast overextended thy muscles. If thou couldst return at a later date, I would be quite willing to train thee."
"He wasn't talking to thee!"
"I am carrying many items, some of which may be of use to thee. Wouldst thou care to have these back?"
"Then it is good to see another member of our old sowing circle once again!"
"Marsten is the Lord of Monitor. One day he will give a banquet in mine honor to celebrate my becoming a Knight."
"When the Guardian appeared, we feared thou wert taken. Thou must hurry, I have found a way for thee to return home!"
"Brrr. Dost thou notice the chill in the air? 'Tis much colder here than at home."
"And I will search for her, yes, search for her,"
"I have an apprentice. I have automatons to help the work progress. That makes me a Master."
"That seems alike to the bow I did lose to the magical storm!"
Day 24: Still looking for the miser's treasure.
"Then I shall return to destroy thy mortal soul!"
"Cassie is my daughter. Just a wee babe, she is mine only joy."
"Thy behavior hath disrupted this celebration. In the interest of calming all of our tempers, I declare this banquet to be over."
"Is the price acceptable?"
"I accept guilders only!"
"Thou shouldst as least tell her that thou hast seen it -- it will cheer her."
"He was an old farmer named Brownie. Didn't have much money to put into a campaign. Even the peasants didn't support him."
"Well, all that is the past, and there is nothing one can do for the dead. And we have the treasure..."
"What an interesting Beauty mark thou hast... I am Lady Yelinda, ruler of Fawn -- the city of Beauty."
"If thou hast spoken to each of us and hast determined that one of us is guilty, accuse accordingly. But be not hasty in thy judgment."
"She is also known as the Green Enchantress. She's quite pretty, in her own way. For a Mage..."
"No, I did not find him. At least, not right away. But I did see something."
"I am a sculptor by trade. There is a brisk business to be done in this city, fashioning busts and statues for the Knights."
"At the end of this corridor lies the grand shrine of Order. That is where the Hierophant performs the ceremony to open the Wall of Lights."
"The automatons are harder to deal with..."
"I'm afraid thy daughter is not lively enough for me, old man."
"Mother, come and hear this! The customer jests with me!"
"Thou dost know the reasons."
"I do not think I shall be thy friend unless thou dost acquire better manners!"
"'Tis their honor to oversee the fleets and all trade matters."
"What a sourpuss! Wouldn't even share a glass of ale with me..."
"'Tis a Death Knight, whose sole purpose is to slay the victim he is promised. Columna pledged my soul to this one."
"I have not seen them since they gave me my training session, many days ago."
"I have nothing against thee, but I fear that Thoxa's willful interference shall be the undoing of all for which we have prepared."
"I am Ian."
"To hope the Hero comes soon..."
"Not all of Xenka's followers believe that we should take direct action in aiding thee. However, Thoxa and I disagree."
"Perhaps another time then..."
"They are the people that hold the keep. Quite warlike, really. I don't have much to do with them..."
"Couldst thou please make up thy mind!?"
"Here they are."
"I am Surok, the Healer of Serpent's Fang and I perceive that thou art lost. Perhaps I can aid thee, if thou dost wish."
"But I think thou art too old to learn spell-casting..."
"I've enjoyed jawin' with ye, mate, but I'd better be back to me duties..."
"Do not go in! You will surely die!"
"Fruits are pleasant-tasting, like the honey you gave us!"
"I am Renfry, Knight and Cremator."
"Aye, the City of Mages. There is much magic here, and more than a little sorcery."
"What dost this villain look like?"
"It is a sad ballad indeed..."
"My greatest difficulty is in finding any significant quantity of silver snake venom. But it is by no means mine only difficulty."
"That blasted storm exchanged all of mine equipment for useless refuse! Even mine enchanted shield!"
"I was a wife, and a mother, Hero. I did not ask to become a prophetess."
"Thou art one among many that have come seeking the wisdom of The Fellowship to withstand these difficult times."
"The land to the northeast is a bit dry, but the oasis and nearby shores give us plenty of water for drinking and bathing."
"Then explain to me thy friend's actions. Is he a sorcerer?"
"If I were thee, I would speak to MageLord Filbercio about this matter. Mages are involved, so thy duty is clear."
"She is so serious about becoming a Knight. All she ever does is practice with her wooden sword."
"What coins wilt thou pay me with?"
"I cannot imagine where Batlin is. He never misses Fellowship meeting!"
"Oh, darling! Let us meet in my bedroom..."
"I am the caretaker here. It is my duty to record thy name and crime."
"'Twould be a shame for all this to go to waste..."
"Wouldst thou like something else?"
You see a roguish man dressed in what appears to be some nobleman's ratty hand-me-downs.
"We are all Knights here. If thou art not a Knight of Monitor, then thou dost not belong in Monitor!"
"How repugnant."
"Edrin! Thou hast come..."
"Dost thou want me to wait here or dost thou truly want me to leave and go home?"
"All of a sudden one of those storms hit and Olon and I dove for cover under a rowboat."
"This is not thine usual love story, no. This here's about dragons, ice dragons."
"Through it I have the power to heal the land when harm hath come to it, and I can summon the Hound of Doskar."
"Why, that fat sage that passed through town a while ago. Batlin. I remember not the specifics of the transaction."
"And you, my rock-brained monks! Is this how you serve my visions?! You cannot even take the words down properly!"
"A love story about ice dragons! Now I've heard everything, even from thee, Olon."
"Unless it is a special order, mine automaton makes it. For something non-magic, talk to Topo. If it's magic, talk to me."
"As for the earring, it is inscribed with serpentine runes of ancient design."
"Thou art certainly ignorant!"
The woman greets you with shining eyes.
She closes her eyes a moment.
"A tragedy that the two of thee were unable to settle thy differences amicably."
"Simrek is my name."
"What else didst thou see in the Knight's Test?"
"We fight for virtues, far and wide, ~And we cause the damsel's sigh."
"Thou be Avatar! Thou nice!"
"I would give thee an apple to show thee my sincerity, but it seems thou art too encumbered."
"To have no desire to tell you. To demand to know who you are!"
"Rest easy. I will help thou."
"Splendid! Let's see, we agreed on 5 gold per portion, if I remember correctly."
"Dost thou remember his precise words?"
"Go places thou art not wanted, and look for the hidden things. Surely, thou wilt find a clue."
"All I can tell thee is that there were three of them. And one was very large and went heavily-cloaked."
"My honor is worth more than that! I shall not have it said that I betrayed Order!"
"In the dungeon, thou didst slay the animal which the Ashes of Gurnordir did send to thee."
"I have heard nothing more of the Crown Jewel since we last spoke of it."
"I once heard that the strange birds of the north lay blue eggs."
You see a cute-looking woman who beams with a huge smile when she notices you looking at her.
"They have been trying to discourage me from using the button on the left... but there are powerful rewards for pressing that button!"
"As I have told thee, I am called Richter."
"Hold thou still while I apply these directly upon thy tattoo..."
You see a stern shopkeeper who might once have been a strong fighter.
"Here is thy sextant. She shall steer thee true, to be sure."
"To have nothing to fear, if you are the Hero. To meditate to give you strength."
"Thou wilt indeed be pleased with thy purchase. We have only the finest produce."
"Thou art correct!"
The Three Grand Shrines were divided into Balance, Chaos and Order.
"If thou canst not pay, please leave!"
"But I will gladly suffer his speeches if they can help me find the way to restore mine husband."
"I thought that thou didst have a challenge for me! This one is easy... It is a Pikemen's shield from Monitor."
"If thou dost love, if thou hast compassion for others, if thou dost feel the injustice of the world, art thou not said to possess a soul?"
"Then what are the answers?"
"Where are thy manners"?!"
"'Twill cost thee 4 gold each. Still interested?"
The woman smiles at you compassionately.
"'Tis a fabulous place to work. I absolutely love it. I would not work anywhere else. I have more gold than I could possibly spend."
"I was allied with Rotoluncia, but her death makes our partnership void."
"Thou hast sorely disappointed me. What of our bargain?"
"On behalf of the Bears -- which, by the way, are the mightiest warriors in the land -- I welcome thee to thy Knighthood Banquet."
"Beware claws of Ice Dragon!"
"She is a wise and compassionate leader. Everyone doth love her. Her beauty is only rivaled by that of Kylista."
"I am the King of the White Dragon!"
"Special things about blood of Ice Dragon that can cure almost any sickness."
"That had best be true, or thou wilt find thyself on the scrap heap!"
"What dost thou desire?"
"I do not know thee!"
Hook points to you.
"If I do say so myself, I am a master of cooking poultry. Or as they say..."
"Say, we should get to know one another better!"
"This odd party came asking about the Serpent ruins. The mage was unusually interested in anything to do with the Serpent people."
"Wilt thou accept this price?"
"Oh, my. He's wet, is he not? Couldst thou be a dear and change him for me? I would appreciate it!"
"Perhaps thou couldst come for healing when I am working in my shop."
"I am the custodian of the Manor. I assist the Master in his experiments. I am also called upon to do the housekeeping."
"Ve do not blame Sasha for vhat happened. Ve vill not punish him."
"Forgive me, Avatar. I must prepare for thy banquet."
"I do not think I'll be back for quite a while, Avatar. Thou shalt have to find the way out thyself."
"Wait, where is it? Thou dost not have it. I hope thou hast not lost it. Thou shouldst go and find it. 'Tis an important document!"
"Yes, frankly, 'tis true. But I do not like to talk about it."
"Good for thee. I would have had to kill thee. I am Garok Al-Mat. At least, the last time I looked in the mirror, that was who I was!"
"Here is thy room key. It is only good until thou leavest the inn."
"At long last thou hast returned! I have kept it safe for all the centuries since thou wert last here!"
"Gwenno killed by The Trapper's men."
"Thou art not ready to learn yet!"
"If we can find her, then we shall find him!"
"I thank thee for bringing the one thing that could save daughter."
"Perhaps I should bow."
"Aye, tis true. I have a treasure. What self-respecting dragon doesn't have a treasure horde?"
"Some silver serpent venom was stolen from the merchant Morfin who operates the slaughterhouse."
"To be done!"
You see a young man balancing a dagger on the tip of his finger. He tries hard to ignore you.
"I am without job. All Emps are without jobs. Food gathering and shelter-building are Emp jobs."
"I think this be the right key..."
"The Banes are only insane because of the Imbalance. Restore Balance, and they shall be healed!"
"I can give thee 800 filari for every gold bar thou hast."
"Thy courage doth delight the soul of a weary rebel like myself."
"His attempts to wrest life from death have been rather pathetic. And he hath gone completely mad."
"Here, take bucket of mine. If thou find and slay Ice Dragon, please bring bucket of blood. Take to Yenani, she know what to do with it."
"Unusual taste, eh? I dare say I am the only one outside of the city of Fawn who drinks it."
"If we ever come into conflict over the gold that I know lies somewhere in this land, I shall kill thee dead without an ounce of regret."
"That rascal does not come around very often, though I understand he spends most of his time in Britain these days!"
"Thou shalt need a boat to reach this place. Take my yacht. I give thee permission."
"Oh, mindest thou not."
"Dost thou find the rate acceptable?"
"Yes! Greater powers! He called to the Serpents of Order and Chaos. He spoke with Demons. Only the Chaos Serpent would hear him!"
"Yes, master."
"Thou canst sing along if thou wishest..."
"Anyway, for some reason he doth refuse to sail again. I do wish he would change his mind, or that another ship would arrive."
"But thou dost not have any Caddellite chunks with which to make helmets!"
"Once thou hast found the jawbone, return to me -- for I have something else to give thee as well."
"Gustacio is an Adept that specializes in working with the weather... the power of nature, and all that."
"For but 5 gold thou canst let one of our lovely rooms. Dost thou wish to stay here for the night?"
"Now that we have recaptured the Fawn Tower, our security is again guaranteed."
"Thou art so encumbered! Perhaps one of thy friends might be willing to carry this?"
"Handsome lad... I do not recall him. Dost thou think he would be a worthy suitor for mine Alyssand?"
"Thou dost not have the gold for that!"
I'd be a hen, and I'd have a good lay.
"An' what's worse, Lady Yelinda tells me that I'm ta be in charge of the restorations!"
"Such curiosity seems most impudent, considering that thou art a stranger in this land..."
"$Temp4Flag was set to true."
"I told thee. We have been here a long time."
"He is an extraordinary leader. Everyone looks up to him. Thou hast only to ask his captain."
"It seems thou dost not have enough gold to train at this time."
"Here they are."
"I do not recall, exactly. Something about his impoverished wife and family starving to death in Paws or some load of rubbish."
The man before you narrows his eyes to slits as he sees you.
"Leon was especially chosen by Batlin to come and bring the hope of The Fellowship to this land."
"How can I concentrate on teaching thee spells when I am freezing to death by the moment?"
"Why, I already gave thee my prize! What more dost thou expect?"
"If thou hast not had the chance yet, do look around and meet them. They are most wonderful and amusing."
"I thought as much!" Lasher starts to pace nervously. "If thou wouldst not mind standing back a bit, I would be most appreciative."
"I seek to find union with the corn. I am a Child of the Corn."
"Voldin doth scheme endlessly in his cell, but what can come of it?"
"As I have said, I was rooked by a professional. A Master Criminal, no doubt -- and one who is still at large!"
"I'm certain that thou hadst help from thy companions to come this far, girl."
"Wouldst thou like another spell?"
"If thou dost not do this, the ghost of the dead will torment thee until thy dying day!"
"Dost thou want me to make an honor flag that can be given to the Library of Scars so the duels can be stopped?"
You see a handsome, muscular man with an air of mischief about him.
"Thieves could not take thy goods, MageLord. I protect them well."
"That is all right."
"Mine old hourglass! I suppose I could revitalize the enchantment upon it."
"As thou wishest..."
"If thou dost have no gems for sale then do not even waste my time by mentioning it!"
"Please make up thy mind!"
"To mine for the Mining company here. To be the only gargoyle still mining here." He nods his head.~~ "To be very tolerant, like For-Lem."
"Oh, art thou ready to join The Fellowship?"
"Cador is mine husband. He is the overseer at the Britannian Mining Company here in Vesper."
"Hah! A fine shield like this is not for sale. It is a family heirloom, after all."
"He is basically a good boy. He works hard and misses his father."
"Wisps are known to me," he nods. "Wisps are found in the woods. What is your concern?"
"I am not!"
"I would love to converse with thee, friend Avatar. But this is the hour when Andral sculpts my likeness."
"Within a person, like thy friend Gwenno, the lack of Discipline would produce Wantonness... Much like the behavior she is exhibiting now."
"I understand that coward Sprellic has given thee the flag so that it may be returned to us. Thou hadst better hand it over."
"Thou art a stranger in Paws. Beware the thief who roams this town! The culprit has stolen a quantity of my valuable silver serpent venom!"
"Shouldst thou not lend thy bravery to the cause of restoring our city's safety, noble Pikeman?"
"Through a mystical process, this causes one's own totem animal to appear. Thus, it is revealed to which Command thou dost belong."
"Yenani, silly! She chieftain of our tribe. She tell me one day, after I grow, that what I be."
"To charge 50 gold for each training session. To be acceptable?"
"Thou must also bring the Banes, imprisoned within the Prisms which thou hast fashioned."
"But Adepts, being the pompous lot they are, fail to see anything other than a magical attack as a threat."
"So be it..."
"Ahem--! Also present, as my dinner companion, is the most charming Frigidazzi. She, too, is a Mage."
"'Tis good to meet thee!"
"Excellent! Then go and bring to me my phoenix egg. I shall send thee there immediately."
"Be wary for there is a thief in this town! Some silver serpent venom was stolen from the merchant Morfin, who runs the slaughterhouse."
"Thou dost not need to know any more."
"Wouldst thou like something else?"
"The world is divided into two sorts of Men -- those who can handle magics, and mere ordinary folk."
"It must have had something to do with that older sister of hers. Selene was taken by the Mages of Moonshade when a mere child."
"Thou mayest come see me after the duels and exchange this marker for thy winnings if thou hast won."
"Thou hast never met such a creature before...? If thou dost wish it I shall tell thee my tale."
"I am so sorry, the clothier's shop is closed. Please return during our regular business hours. We are open from nine until six every day."
"Wouldst thou care to spend a while longer listenin' to another story?"
"I am in charge of the Minoc branch of the Britannian Mining Company."
"Hast thou come for instruction in the path of Beauty?"
"He is my long-lost father. Here is a scroll thou canst give him from me."
"He is dead, he is dead... The Glowing Man turned him into cold, cold stone. He is standing in the Seminarium..."
You see an attractive, studious-looking man.
"Finally, the secrets of the universe are nearly within my grasp!"
"If thou dost need a ship be sure to come back here."
"As I have said before, I am very good at riddles. Art thou sure that thou doth want to play?"
"I have stood alone in the temple gazing at it, and I will tell thee that it is a living being trapped there in that statue."
"If thou wilt return when we are open, I will sell thee a drink!"
"My price is 35 gold for each training session. Art thou willing to pay that?"
"Well, I still think 'tis the work of them mages! No good comes of controlling that type of power, I'll tell thee..."
"Far away, near where the sun doth rise, there once a mountain stood."
"Please accept this gift as an expression of my sincerest gratitude."
"It is ancient, proud Gwani name. It mean 'Blizzard' in our tongue."
"Other pelts I obtain from the northern trappers. They supply exotic furs which are rare here in Monitor -- especially Gwani pelts!"
"He is my companion and fellow student. We have been friends for a very long time. And his mastery of magic is almost as great as mine own."
"I believe that the Ophidian government disintegrated and their society split into two opposing groups."
"Very well."
"Andrew is such a happy young man. He doth not notice the myriad of personal problems that he is afflicted with."
"Return when thou art ready."
"Er, no, not at all. I only meant I did not see any Goblins then."
"Here is your whistle."
"I am glad that thou didst kill him -- glad!"
"He is merely following his leader, Caladin -- they all think the Wolves are their enemies!"
"Avatar, when our paths cross once more I shall chop thee into little pieces and feed them to the dogs!"
"His knowledge of the history of these islands hath been invaluable!"
"To barter coins, I charge a small fee of the money exchanged. Dost thou agree?"
"To know that this is not yet, but shall soon be. These are the Enemies of the Hero."
"She, too, is a prisoner of Beauty! Yelinda must not strain herself, lest she mar her perfect appearance with any sign of weariness."
"I share thy grief over the loss of Goodwife Gwenno. I am sure that we can resurrect her, if thou dost wish."
"Budo the Fourth at thy service! 'Tis a fine day today, is it not?"
"As thou wishest!"
"Thy kind hath destroyed the Balance... All power now rests with the Order villains!"
"This place becomes quite... unkempt, and requires constant cleaning. 'Tis a dreadful thing to do! I hate the cleanings! I hate them!"
"Wilt thou agree?"
"I went there once, as a young lad. That's what inspired me to become a Ranger."
"I regret that thou wilt not aid the Cause. Nevertheless, we will not be turned from our quest to save this society."
"East of my dwelling the wood is thick, but a woodcrafty traveller may find the houses there."
"Sherry is a special mouse who has lived here in the castle for many, many years. She recites stories for the children."
"If it weren't for me and the automatons, he'd have to join old Mosh out begging!"
"Delin hath not been quite right since his wife died, and the Magister came to take away his infant child."
"That is what my Master actually specializes in... making everyone else do his work!"
"He must not be allowed to hold the hallowed key!!"
"I am the Trinsic healer. I can perform a heal, a poison cure, or a resurrection on any of thy friends. Or on thee, of course."
"Thou dost already know my partner, Malloy."
"Filbercio hath been trying to coerce Columna into a dalliance for some time. But she will have nothing to do with him."
"Thou must use his cage well to stop the liche."
"Well, I say if it is magical, then force him to not use it! Monitorians do not use magic weapons or armour..."
"To know this is the reason why great storms now howl across the face of this world, hurling their lightnings down."
"Run back to town like a good boy. I am sure the Lady would find ye an interesting pet."
"Oh, I'll grant that there's a hot predator under that shroud of ice, but few have seen it."
"To be without enough gold!"
"Anything else ye want?"
"Art thou ready to answer some questions concerning the investigation?"
"Why, that looks to be a funeral urn. In our city, it is our custom to burn our dead, and keep their remains in such urns."
"Hast thou had a chance to sample any of my bread yet?"
"I can show thee, if thou wouldst like... Or thou canst press the button on the left post and see for thyself."
"People! Hrrmphh. Thou dost realize, I hope, that not every sentient creature likes to be characterized in human terminology."
"Go thou and find it. I am certain that it will help thee."
"Then I have nothing more to say to thee!"
"'Tis doom! 'Tis despair! 'Tis death! ~My beloved wife is gone! ~Disease has taken her away ~And left me with but a song."
"I am Delphynia, horticulturist and healer. Welcome, noble Pikeman. Thy presence honors me."
"I am only an automaton, with no hope that any soul I may have will join Rocco in the world beyond this one. There is nothing left for me."
"I must return to my duties. These crops will not wait!"
"That individual does not need curing!"
"Do not involve me in such matters, stranger! Canst thou not see that I am a Mundane?"
"No doubt the Master is yet at home, getting his rest after a long day."
"If thou must know, I am Julia, chief of rangers. If thou dost make trouble in Moonshade, I will see that thou art sent to the dungeons!"
"Greetings, felon!"
"We are betrayed! Take them from my sight! I shall deal with their perfidy later..."
"Delphynia knows of my love, though she is unsure of her feelings for me."
"Thou wert wise to collect that scroll, Avatar. It probably contains clues which will be useful to us later."
"Thou cannot possibly carry that much!"
"Anyone could tell thee that fur comes from the north, on the mainland beyond the great swamp."
"But thou dost not have the coins to pay for thy purchase! Next time, thou shouldst count thy coins first."
"To see there are troubles here, but to be unaware of the causes and solutions."
He almost appears disappointed, but it seems more likely that it's your imagination.
"I am honored to see thee again, Champion of Balance."
"Thou art seeking brushes? Perhaps Topo the Artisan could help thee -- he makes many things for the Master Artisan."
"It was once the property of the Goblin chieftain who nearly conquered Monitor!"
"I can give thee 100 monetari for any piece of jewelry thou hast."
"Why, here in Britain I sell the best armour and weapons that money can buy. In my spare time, I do deeds for The Fellowship."
"I Myauri, hunting master. My mate Yenani chieftain of our people. I am father of Neyobi and Kapyundi."
"Monitor is not the town it once was. Our ancestors founded a settlement built on the Principle of Courage."
"A swarthy man who was called Deadeye. He had the look of a pirate about him. Shazzana spent a bit of time with him as I recall."
"Filbercio's unjust rule hath been brought to an end!"
"Thou art a no more than a coward. Get thee gone, coward!"
"I am waiting to receive the password."
"Thou dost tread on dangerous ground with such accusations..."
"He was also not nearly as skilled as my... brother, being many years Argus' junior."
"Speak thy mind, then, warrior."
"Good, join. See Abraham or Danag about join."
"Zulith is a puppet for Kylista and the Great Captains. But beware of him, friend, for he can be vicious if slighted."
"To regret that we cannot make peace with them."
"Then perhaps thou shouldst try one."
"Thou art ready! Now thou must meet Lord Marsten at the Great Hall, in the south part of town."
"How many dost thou desire?"
"To delay my purpose no longer..."
"What dost thou say?"
"And that fiend, Batlin, I hope!"
"He vas my brother-in-law. His death makes me very sad."
"How many dozen wouldst thou like?"
"To want how many?"
"But I must remain here and study! I must help thee find a way to restore my dear Iolo!"
"All the Knights think about is fighting! And who do they fight? The Goblins? No! They prefer to spar with one another at the List Field!"
"Thou art unwounded!"
"Often I am called upon by Caladin to lead patrols outside the city walls, or to single-handedly scout the wilderness. I am very brave."
"The finest eating and drinking establishment in all Moonshade! Run by the finest man in all Moonshade..."
"Our rooms are cheap. Only 6 gold per person per night. Want a room?"
"I am carrying many items, some of which may be of use to thee. Wouldst thou care to have these before I depart?"
"If thou dost tell anyone that I accepted such an offer, I will say that thou art a liar."
"To know that the only exit is at the brass gate at where we first met. To know that Men are too weak to pull the levers to open it."
"If thou art serious about mastering magic, perhaps thou shouldst speak with Master Fedabiblio at the Seminarium."
"Thou dost not have enough gold!"
"Then prove it. Talk to me."
"Ah! But thou hast not the practical experience to train with me at this time! Go and experience life and return later."
Smiling gently, she hands you a carrot.
"I am Alyssand, daughter of Delin. I am a weaver by trade." *"How might I be of assistance?"
"To be named Inforlem. To be very strong."
"Thy companions carry some of thine inventory."
"Order is folly! The world has blinded itself to this truth, and I shall force them to see!"
"I wish I could have been of more help to thee..."
Black Rock can be found in small quantities beneath the ground, sometimes near lodes of iron ore or lead.
"My name be Mole, it be! Do not ask me how I came by it. 'Tis a long story."
"How didst thou come by that?!"
"Thou canst lie in comfort among the many soft cushions and pillows. Get to know thy neighbor. Get to know thy neighbor 'very well'!"
"An' there be nobody brave enough to even sail the rowboats! Not in these storms..."
"Perhaps Simon could tell thee more."
"This is a favorable sign for Kane. It may well mean that his brother is not in the realm of ghosts."
"Thou dost not trust me? Then be on thy way! All I wanted were the stockings..."
"Excellent! Hast thou brought some pumpkins for me?"
"Hail to Lady Yelinda, Hail to the Oracle, hail to... hail to everyone!"
"The jeweller's shop is currently closed for business. Come back later!"
"Thou wilt have to take thy chances outside."
"For you to talk to wisps is still your wish? Then helping you is my goal. A whistle can be made by me."
"What spell dost thou wish to buy?"
"I am sure thou canst find it."~~The ruler smiles slyly. "Consider it something of a game!"
"Sounds like the work of those horrible wizards from Moonshade! No respect for life!"
"Couldn't say more than that. Merely an ordinary knave."
"Who knows? Who cares? They've been trying to destroy each other ever since."
"She keeps the records at town hall."
"In which circle art thou interested?"
"Without it, she would be exactly like me! I know not where she keeps it. But I am certain it is in a well hidden spot."
"I am a trainer here in Trinsic," he says gruffly. "If thou dost wish to increase thy skill in combat I can help thee."
"Cantra misses her father terribly. He hath been gone for many weeks..."
The Cube vibrates.
"They brought thee here along their way to Terfin."
"I thank thee. I always endeavor to be correct."
The Ophidians are the inhabitants of this continent.
"This town would have been ruined if I had allowed that monument to be built, so I immediately forbade it, of course."
"Thou didst call, Lord Caladin?"
"To be thought of as the trolls' communication. To be trouble for all within the sound of the drums."
"The rooms are upstairs. If thou dost need anything, thou shouldst call."
"Just as he stole my little Freli..."
"I think that thou wouldst benefit from the wisdom of an honest tradesman. Perhaps it would divert thy mind from a foolish girl's dreams."
"Cellia the Furrier shall make thee the Cloak of Knighthood, if thou shalt take to her the body of thy totem animal."
"Oh, all right! Don't be testy!"
"But thou hast not got any cheese!"
"I must not tell! In fact, thou shouldst leave here at once."
"None of us have seen Number 7 since the day that I was with Number 1."
"I am not one to waste time with words. What is thy business with me, Knight?"
"He is the Lord of the Town. Thou shouldst talk to him if thou hast not already."
"'Tis not such an indecent offer." ~"I accept."
Day 40: This hideout is not easy to find. The men are becoming nervous.
"Sounds dangerous to me..."
"To be agreed!"
"Dost thou want to join?"
"I am Lord Heather. And I recognize thee, Avatar!"
"We are the strongest of the Commands. The Goblins shall never break this city, so long as we are here to man the walls!"
"He is the Lord of Serpent's Hold. He is a capable leader and a fair man."
Tonight sleep is not to be found. I must go out, explore and meet the creatures of the night.
The man's eyes focus on the Fellowship medallion around your neck.
"Most of the offenders that find themselves within the confines of Freedom are there because they angered Filbercio in some way."
"Such visitors are rare, for the journey here is not an easy one. As I remember it, our last visitor was that woman, Gwenno."
"I have not lost my shield. Thou art mistaken."
"Hmpf. For a Fellowship member, thou dost lack recognition. Thou dost not understand the teachings of The Fellowship."
"If thou art willing to allow me to join thee, I can lead thee to treasure enough for both of us."
"Thou must return later when thou hast enough room in thy pack for these markers."
"Thou dost want these, eh?" he asks, holding up keys. "'Twill cost thee... 20 gold. Still want them?"
"Well, mayhap some other time, then."
"But it might kill thee! Or worse, thou mightest be trapped in this wall in my place!"
Yes, indeed, how? Oh! I remember, thou hast only to crush it into a fine powder.
"Thou canst defeat me, Avatar. But thou hast no hope against the power of Iolo the Mad..."
"It hath been a pleasure trading with thee! Most men would try to take advantage of my sweet nature and lower my price even further!"
"It is not fitting that I be seen with thee until thou hast been judged by the Oracle."
"As an expert craftsman, I can tell thee what most materials are, if I can examine the item."
"Before the land can again live in Balance, the Banes must once more become the Chaos Serpent, united and intelligent."
"Curious, the Bane of Chaos is an Ophidian term."
"Magic, in and of itself, is neither good nor evil. But sorcery is another matter altogether."
You see an aged gargoyle, bent and withered, with a regal bearing. He smiles gently.
"The entire crystal is what thou didst find in Rabindrinath's Keep when thou didst kill him."
"Could that person be thee? I would like it to be so."
"Wilt thou pay the 45 gold for the training session?"
"Please come to the Tavern then and I will be happy to serve thee."
"I know thou wilt find that man."
"Art thou jealous of me to change thy mind so? If so, I am not amused!"
Find the best weapon and armour thou canst obtain.
Though he does not seem hostile, the man greets you in a fighting stance.
"Thou hast not heard a revelation from the Oracle yet?"
"I'll wager being a bird would give anyone nightmares..."
"To be caretaker and group leader for the altars of the three principles. To wish to make a donation?"
"I have overwhelmed thee with sheer strength. Learn from this lesson, my friend."
"Art thou referring to me?"
"I raise pumpkins. But I am in a bind at the moment and need some help."
"Xenka saw that the one hope for our world was that A Hero from Another World would sail a ship upon dry land."
"None can say if they are intelligent." ~"They build no structures and speak no recognizable language."
"That would be Camille and her son Tobias."
"I must be getting back to work now. But it hath been nice talking with thee."
You see a tough-looking guard who takes his job -very- seriously.
"If thou dost trust thy brother, thou wouldst not live in fear. Without fear, our lives are happier and Unity may grow and thrive."
You see a very clean-looking, portly young man who waves at you frantically.
"Thou hast slain me! My blood spills away... all because of Pomdirgun, that betrayer!"
"Thou dost not have enough guilders to purchase this..."
"While the Virtues that Lord British expounded are all very well and good, they are nearly impossible for ordinary people to achieve."
"Thou mayest have noticed the various sculptures around the town. I crafted many of them."
"All hail the Lady Yelinda, who hath condescended to conduct this portion of the trial in person."
"All right, then..."
"Do not speak of this to the Sorceress Frigidazzi! She is my current passion, and I fear that she doth love me too much."
"I am currently seeking the murderer of my father."
"Aye, bribed!" ~"I heard some of those scum..."
"Dost thou desire my body, Avatar?"
"Thou cannot possibly carry that much!"
"To want to buy how many sets of twelve?"
Lasher stares blankly at you. His mouth hangs open. "Very well. Then I shall tell thee what a unicorn is.
"Wilt thou reconsider and aid this poor soul's search for love?"
"Then thou dost leave me no choice!"
"I would thank thee not to repeat that in here. As Petra says, no use borrowing trouble..."
"Thoxa hath told us that thy ship was found beyond the shore. And thou wert accompanied by three fine companions, as foretold."
"My father says that Chaos is the True Path, and that the Chaos Serpent will lead us to a better life."
"Dost thou wish to spend more time in my domain?"
"Mere foolishness. Everyone knows that Beauty is what is important."
"Hmmm. Thou dost not have enough gold!"
"Sadly, she pays no more heed of him than her mirror. Her interests, I think, lie more in line with Jorvin, Captain of the Guard."
"It is the goal of the devout to live pure lives, so that we can ascend to the Void and merge with the Greater One."
"To warn you that many hold resentment for their poor treatment. To be careful, please."
"What does it look like I do?" he says, holding up a ring of keys. "Gardening?"
"Marvelous! The world will be a better place!"
"I cannot... it is not permitted... words cannot be spoken..."
"Imparting such information is risky. Thou dost offer too little in exchange for mine health..."
You see the familiar face of your good friend, Dupre. While somewhat older, he still seems full of his usual casual good humor.
"Now leave me, so that I may peruse this matter."
"Thou art carrying too much to take the room key!"
"Lady Yelinda will surely wish to meet thee, a shining example of Beauty!"
"Yes, a good price that is!"
"Oh. Well, the next time thou art in Cove, perhaps thou wilt find time to see him."
"Perhaps thou shouldst speak with Brendann. He hath had the most -- ahem -- experience with women from outside the town."
"Thou shouldst speak to she who hath done me wrong: The Sorceress Columna, whom they sometimes call the Green Sorceress."
"Oh please! Not another Avatar!"
"Wilt thou agree to my rate?"
"And to love! Let us drink to the virtues of romance and bliss!"
"So, thou art still alive!" ~"I had wondered when thy companion arrived in such a strange state."
"Oooh! Thou dost infuriate me! Just like a man to lead a poor girl on so!"
"Wilt thou tell me?"
That last blow was perhaps a bit too hard, It'll take a while to hammer out the flaws.
"I advise thee to speak to Fedabiblio -- he can counsel thee well. And he doth have connections in high places."
"To blazes with the Avatar!" She kisses him again. "The Avatar is the last one who will convince thee to settle down."
"I'd wager that it was as gruesome as the King of the White Dragon's castle."
"Thou wouldst not be so hard, Shamino, if thou hadst lost thy love!"
"Voldin is a cruel man who secretly despises women. If there is an evil scheme, then Voldin must be the mastermind."
"Art thou an official envoy from Serpent's Fang?"
"Very good. At last we are getting somewhere!"
"To be named Inmanilem."
"Karnax is quite pompous. He is more inclined to lecture me than to help."
"Perhaps another time then..."
"Shows what thou knowest, Jendon. We bards would call that a tragedy."
"I hope Gwenno brought enough warm clothing..."
"Thou hast destroyed a great tradition, foreigner! It was glorious, while it lasted..."
"Dost thou have the glass petals of Love to bind thy dreams? Canst thou swim the seas of death and come forth the father of power?"
The Liche practically glows, power coursing visibly through its undead veins.
"To have healed the wounds."
"'Tis reminiscent of the problems that are occurring in Britannia this very instant!"
"I believe that The Fellowship is an invention of Beast British, by which he means to destroy us!"
"Xenka speaks of these days as the Time of Imbalance."
"Be gone... Before I fetch Rocco to break thy thick head for thee!"
"Breasts and thighs, breasts and thighs. And which dost thou prefer, milord? But do not answer yet..."
"And who is this fine young lad?"
"'Tis time for thy banquet, Avatar. Thou shouldst make haste."
"Welcome to the Blue Boar Inn. I am the innkeeper. My name is Rocco."
"Thou cannot possibly carry that much!"
"Strange," he says, puzzled. "I am at a loss then to explain my arrival here.~Regardless, I -must- find a way to restore life to him!"
"That could be it, right enough. Though thou shouldst ask Alyssand herself. Mine eyes are not what they were."
"To be the healer."
"We had despaired of falling to their newfound unity. But we have hope again now that the tower hath been retaken."
"Oh dear. Thou art carrying too much to take the room key."
"I was a fool to join with thee, Avatar! Now I am to lose my life in this foolish quest."
"What dost thou say to this?"
"There is another who awaits thee there. She would aid thee, but of necessity her aid will be strange to thee."
"'Tis certainly a unique bottle, unlike common ale bottles."
"The Sorceress Frigidazzi met secretly with me, and expressed her sorrow at what had been done to thee."
"To be foolish to accept so little!"
"The Goblins have grown bold of late. They have often come to hurl themselves upon our gate. Thankfully, we have held fast so far."
"If thou changest thy mind, thou hast but to return and ask again."
"Indeed, I am one of the Three who rule this city, along with Gustacio the Decrepit, and that weak-willed profligate, Filbercio."
"Please! Make thyself at home. If thou dost want a drink, let me know."
"Hath vengeance been exacted upon Batlin for his evil deeds?"
"I have trained for a long time to become a Knight. There is nothing in the world so wonderful as being a Knight!"
"Failure in BrendanUsable(_Path_Failure) because we failed in our pathfind."
"I do not believe I could return home without thy guidance... For all that I am an Adept."
Dispose of the Avatar quickly. Destroy this note. No evidence should be left behind thee.
"But, if thou wilt suffer to call me by name, I am Draxta."
"I sometimes carry a spell scroll or two... May as well make use of any edge I can acquire."
Herein, I will show thee that there are no shortcuts, and the rewards awaiting thee are abundant.
"Aha! And what didst thou conclude from this?"
"Dost thou have it with thee?"
"She may have been a Bear, but she was beautiful..."
"How can thine heart be so hard, Avatar? Thou wouldst search every corner of the land and sea to help me find Gwenno."
"As I have told thee before, the Crown Jewel has not been here in a long time."
You are greeted by a friendly gargoyle.
"How many dost thou want?"
"The three strangers tried to offer me some kind of trinket to build or sell them a ship. It sounds like the locket thou art describing."
"All of these monks are convinced that she will return to help thee finish thy quest... While I wade through all these insane ramblings!"
"Here they are."
"Ah! I do hope thine hands are not too full to take the package."
"Listen carefully -- I shall give thee mine aid this one time, but we must be enemies ever afterward!"
"Perhaps if we can find whom this bottle doth belong to, we shall find our traitor!"
"So few hast thou called... No doubt thy trust in the Oracle's perception will be rewarded."
"And it was I who stole from the town treasury, for we needed the money to acquire a cache of powerful weapons -- explosive weapons..."
"I, too, welcome thee to the ranks of the Knights."
"To be sorely wounded. To attempt to restore them to this world."
"Wouldst thou care for more?"
"Bucia the Shopkeeper hath sent thee to me! And what did she tell thee to ask of me?"
"Why, I run the House of Items here in Paws."
"Cease thy jesting, Avatar! We have serious work to do!!"
"Thou knowest this one..." ~"Wouldst thou like to hear it again?"
"Lucy is a good cook. I recommend everything. Especially Silverleaf."
"Don't take jewels. Thou mightest cheat us by telling us they was worth more than they was!"
"I am a powerful mage! Magic is my milieu! I can sell thee spells or reagents."
Eyeing you carefully, the man before you takes an aggressive stance.
"Thou shouldst speak to mine husband of The Fellowship. I am certain thou wilt be most impressed by what he shall have to tell thee."
"Oh. Well, perhaps thou canst become enlightened another time."
"I think the Council secretly decided to burn him. No one can bring back the dead from ashes."
"Thou dost already have that spell!"
"The bodily wounds have been healed."
You see a wizened female Emp.
"Garth is the most junior of the three Great Captains. His interests seem to lie mostly in impressing the ladies of the city."
"Thou knowest our good friend! He hath deposited himself at the Blue Boar Inn, and hath been trying out the local brews!"
"Canst thou imagine the horrors of being devoured alive?! She was a masterful warrior, and deserved a finer death than this..."
"Since thou dost not have enough room for this last item, it will go on the floor."
"I don't mean any offense to thee, but I think that any maze devised by the mind of man could easily be solved by any sensible dragon!"
"Scots is a fine fellow, though he often seems a bit distracted. He is a cartographer."
The Hero from Another World must encounter again what he thought eradicated. The Cause is good this time.
"Thou hast gotten lucky and bested me! Do not consider this the image of the wilds. The goblins are fierce."
"I do not know how many of us are left now. It seems that most of the manors are abandoned..."
"I can tell thee about The Fellowship's philosophy if thou dost wish."
"See how thou wilt use it... To slay an unarmed man!"
"Rotoluncia's forte is fire spells. So I suppose it follows that she would seek to summon daemons to her service."
"Fedabiblio is the Magister. 'Tis he who directs the Seminarium, where young magelings are taught."
"Thou art too late, Avatar! Nothing can stop me now! The girl is dead and the last Bane is mine!"
"Thou dost take too much upon thyself, woman!"
"They do nothing to help the people improve their lives."
"I am Alina."
"I am undone -- I am outside the Temple, and now the years burden me..."
"But thou shouldst not handle such equipment -- for Mundanes, it could be very dangerous."
"Then I am truly sorry. I must charge what I must charge. We do not live in prosperous times."
"Zounds, I don't know... 'Tis like nothing I've seen before."
"My jokes are very bad. If thou wouldst like, I will tell thee one."
"Anything else for thee today?"
"'Tis thy loss."
"Good. Go to Harnna! Quickly now!"
"He is a great gray wolf, and my longtime friend. He is also a refugee, like myself. We have been through many adventures together."
"Artistry is something that one is born with -- it cannot be learned or imitated. As I was born with the talent, I could not deny my duty."
"Lord Marsten may want us to believe that the traitor hath been caught, but I do not believe it."
The other Fellowship members cheer with pleasure.
"Cap'n Hawk might know! He hath been everywhere in the world!"
"Here it is."
I believe that those ways will show me how to better myself and therefore how to better my life.
"Thou shouldst do well not to waste my time so in the future! I am an important man!"
"I do not want to join them, but they seem all right."
"Thou hast not the gold to train."
"It's true! Lord British knighted him recently. Why he did so, I cannot imagine!"
"I was right! Thou art a sturdy wench! I'll tell thee a fine love story next. Now where was I?"
"I know what thou art, Bane of Chaos. That body is but a shell that thou dost wear."
"In mine own case -- I being but the least of these, my brethren -- I can draw upon the Power of the Void to foster the growth of plants."
"Good, a new face! I am Scots, a geographer. Perhaps thou wouldst share tales of other places with me, so I might add detail to my maps."
"If all the young ladies were bricks in a pile,"
"That rightfully belongs to me, and I find it most suspicious that thou didst come into possession of it!"
"Do not bargain with this devil, Avatar!"
"Ask me these things: where thou must go, what thou must bring, and the rite thou must perform."
"Couldst thou please decide!?"
"This is all so confusing. Lord Brendann is certain that there must be a traitor, and the Wolves are united behind him."
"He is not partial to visitors, so I doubt that thou shalt ever have the chance to make his acquaintance."
"Thou wouldst not recognize a love story if it hit thee between the eyes, Jendon."
"Is that not a funny joke?! Me, a decrepit hag?! The most desired beauty in all of Moonshade?! Once, in my time... In my time..."
"To be happy," he says. "To have wanted to keep it anyway! To tell you to leave."
"Lady Yelinda hath charged me with the task of finding a way to sustain the people until the storms pass."
"How many beasts are discussed in the Bestiary in Erstam's book?"
"Another time, then."
"Oh! I just now noticed thy medallion! Thou dost already know all of this! Thou art one of us! Excuse me for going on and on about it!"
"In former times, 'twas his job to go to the mainland and acquire those babies which had promise of magical powers."
"Then why art thou wasting my time?"
I, Silverpate, will prove thee wrong. I will discover the solution relevant to our matters.
"Then thou art free to take the rocking horse. It is thine!"
"It felt like we were walking into a smith's forge! We had to turn back, and no one hath gone in there since."
"As Edrin hath told thee of me, he hath dreamed of thee. I knew that thou wouldst come... 'Twas only a matter of time."
"It's that place just south of here. It's run by The Fellowship."
"To be named Fodus."
"Last time I looked, they were still in there..."
"See there?"
Herein, I did give thee all thou wilt ever need to know.
"I know that mine only daughter Cantra is now dead. Her spirit hath been haunting me. She is suffering and tormented."
"It occurred immediately after I arrived here..."
"He is Brion's twin brother."
"All right. If thou'lt follow me, then."
"Dupre doth have an evil heart. I'd not be surprised if he were in the service of Daemons."
"In truth, I believed them to be impostors, though they passed the test I put upon them."
"Thou brought blood of Ice Dragon! I must have!"
"Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Topo the Artisan, apprenticed to Master Ducio."
"Arrest... Lord Marsten?"
"So be it..."
I See the frozen waste...
Thou canst never teach a person anything. Thou canst only help him discover wisdom himself...
"My sole hope is now that the conspiracy of Kylista and Voldin hath been exposed the curse which lies upon this land might be raised."
"I did not believe that there was a traitor, but this evidence proves it."
Food is low. Need more firewood.
"Thou dost not have a spellbook."
This elderly mage looks older and more senile than when you last saw him.
"I am ready now! Come to bed, my love!"
"Wouldst thou care for more?"
"Why, to perform magic! It seems that the disturbance in the ether has been repaired! I can also sell thee some reagents or spells."
"The Wolves have been disloyal to Monitor since Brendann took charge. He would have us guard the roads, not the city itself!"
"Speak with me again when thou art serious about learning the secrets of combat."
"This is a wild man, full of passions and lusts! I can feel his eyes on me now..."
"Dost thou want me to wait here or go home?"
And make sure that it doesn't grow stale.
"To say that the Pillar of Ice is broken. To say that the Pillar of Fire yet stands."
"There is not much to say! The one in the cloak spent most of his time in the inn, and seldom spoke."
"Thou cannot possibly carry that much!"
"That disgusting oaf! He wanted to buy a serpent relic from me, but I did not sell it to him!"
"To desire what item?"
"I am afraid I do not know a man of that description."
"Mwaerno. Means 'rain clouds'."
"I am Miranda."
"If thou wouldst return when we are open, perhaps I could serve thee food or drink..."
A winged gargoyle looks at you with interest and obvious intelligence.
You see a young man dressed in an expensive tunic. He is very serious.
"Perhaps I should not say this, but I think Frigidazzi is using Filbercio to gain status within the ranks of the Adepts."
"Tavenor is my name."
"Oh, not again, Olon! If thou drivest away what customers I have left, thou canst find somewhere else ta drink."
"In days long gone, there was a peaceful land called Sosaria. It was a land of many kingdoms and cultures, a paradise of individuality."
"Dost thou wish to exchange more coins?"
"My, thou art touchy! I meant no offense... Only that thou didst not know things that are common knowledge here."
"Now there is one to avoid, if ever there was one!"
"What dost thou care to buy?"
"Thou art truly deserving of such an artifact. But if thou dost not wish to utilize the Shrines, I must respect thy wishes."
"If thou dost wish to learn more of this evil race and its history, speak to Templar. He is an expert on the subject."
"My name is Gordon."
"Our ship was hired by Batlin to transport scholars to explore a new land and spread word of The Fellowship."
"Thou knowest Simon's secret? Doth all of Monitor know?"
"Yes, I have done things to be put in prison for. But I am not ashamed of my life. I do not have to be held accountable to thee about it."
"Thou'st got another reason for askin'?"
"Enjoy thy purchase, felon."
"Ah, I do know what thou dost mean! Thou dost need help, yes?"
"I believe that an attempt will be made on thy life soon. Perhaps, by being forewarned, thou wilt be able to avoid it."
"Ye got ta lighten yer load first!"
"Yes, I love sewing clothing. Wouldst thou be interested in seeing or purchasing some of my creations?"
"We once tried to enter the Temple during the night, while Kylista was with one of her lovers... but the guards foiled our attempt."
"Yet I must hope that thou shalt find his burial site... or all is lost."
"I am a member and I am proud to say I recruit for them as well."
"To feel sorry, but to be busy with other things now. To ask you to come back when I have the time to heal you."
"That is all right. If thou art with my friend here, thou needest not speak with me."
"We should find that rascal Iolo and have him join us as well."
"Thou funny boy, -too-!" Max laughs madly as he throws his pacifier at you. He points at it and says, "Binky!"
"The Goblins have struck again!"
"Ha ha ha ha ha ha!"
"Dost thou want to join?"
"Now, some enjoy talking about him and that female automaton living under the same roof, but not I."
"Then I despair! For without this herb, Draygan cannot be stopped. I am so afraid..."
"Dost thou agree?"
"That name is familiar to me... he came to Moonshade many weeks ago, a large man in a brown cloak of a very common quality."
"Thou art encumbered like a pack mule!"
"That storm transported me to this odd city. Because I am a stranger, they arrested me. They say that I am an enchanter!"
"Dost thou have the protection of Courage to face thy dreams? Can thine helm face the power and kiss the lips of sweet death?"
"What dost thou need? To buy? To look? To talk?"
"I can give thee 1 monetari for every 3 guilders thou hast."
"Ones rank denotes how many warriors one is responsible for. It is always an even number of men, measured in hands -- or groups of five."
"We must find some way of restoring Gwenno's mind! Unless we can do that her precious spirit is lost to me."
"Then thou must look elsewhere for that service."
"Absolutely huge... and ugly!"
"Tolemac and Cubolt are brothers. With Morz's help, they run a farm."
"He is also the teacher of the novices, so I'm certain that he will be able to help thee with any questions thou mightest have."
"I can offer thee wine and ale."
"Art thou not from a strange land that thou dost call Earth?"
"Thou dost look to be brave and trustworthy."
"But we must wait, darling, until we are alone..."
"Goblins have some pretty strange things. Jewelry made from human bones. Drums made with human skin. Much broken glass. Very macabre."
"M'name's Kane. I be searchin' for a Mage to help me find my brother what was lost in the storms, if thou pleasest."
"If thou wouldst like to know about any place within the city, come to me."
"I do hope I remember it..."
"Is there no end to the bickering among the Mages? We have three factions here, and each elects its favorite to the Council of Moonshade."
"Make up thy mind! Art thou following me or not?! If thou art following me then close thy mouth, move thy feet and let us get on."
"Unfortunately, the duels with Sprellic were called off before I had the opportunity to impress Master De Snel."
"Beauty lies in the eye of the beholder..."
"Wilt thou flee with thine old friend Iolo?"
"If thou desirest potions, reagents, or other ingredients such as are customary in the practice of magic, come to my shop."
"Which of my services dost thou have need of?"
"We must smash the Goblins! Their chieftain must be slain, the Helm recovered, and their village pillaged."
"Thou dost have the distinct bearing of a Britannian about thee! No doubt thou art some fiend in league with that evil Beast British!"
"In fact, the traitor had thy missing jewelry! So the Beast hath taught him to steal... using Daemonic powers, I suspect..."
"Bread is hard to make for Emps. No stoves or ovens are owned by Emps. But bread is well liked."
"I am Columna, the Green Enchantress."
"The cost to train with me is 20 gold. Too costly, right?"
"Doesn't it strike thee as odd that the most evil creatures in these caverns are humans?"
You see a sturdy-looking farmer's wife. She gives you a hospitable smile before returning to her chores.
"Do not worry -- I shall personally see that Marsten is hunted down like the dog he is."
"I'm a seafarer. And I do whate'er the Cap'n wants done."
"I could almost suspect thee of charming me..."
"It is his heavy hand that holds the reins of the city. Thou shouldst be careful around him. He is a violent man."
"Thou made a good showing, but fell to my superior skill in the end. With more experience, thou wilt make a fine warrior."
"I Grod. Who you?"
"I am sorry, but thou must be less burdened to receive this one of three greatest of all blessings."
"I will buy leather goods from thee, if thou dost have any."
"They are not anything that I would wear, and Petra's metal feet are never cold... least not as she would notice."
"The banquet cannot begin until thou hast brought the meat from thy totem animal to Lucilla at the pub."
She seems surprised, but quickly recovers.~~"Your feelings are understood by me," she sighs.
"The tales of our forefathers -- about the Daemon King named British, and the lands he stole in the name of Virtue -- are literally true."
"I have not seen food this rich in a long time! The aroma is marvelous!"
Be great amongst the multitude of thy brethren. Relieve commoners and seek their welfare.
"As I have said, I know little of your human rituals, but I do know that these Ophidians worship snakes."
"They say he lives there still, feeding off any who pass by. One thing's for sure, the goblins don't go near that place ta this very day."
"She's what passes for a healer in these forsaken parts ever since the last healer were et by them goblins."
"Thou cannot possibly carry that much!"
"Perhaps I can consult the materials here on Monk Isle and discover a way to rid this land of the threat entirely."
"The Ceremony shall begin."
"I am glad that this situation has concluded in thy favor, dear Henry."
"War is the ultimate test for any Knight. This is how one doth test one's inner strength."
"I am Jesse and I am a star."
"Thou seemest quite healthy!"
"I am Great Captain Garth, but thou canst call me Garth."
"Bold wench, thou art, to wear a tattoo so openly."
"Thou seemest quite healthy!"
"How cute! But dost thou not think it is a bit warm here for a fur cap?" "And... I don't know... But it seems a bit small for thee..."
"Sorry. To look elsewhere for that service then."
"As I have said, I serve and protect my master's household."
"No one can restore the life to my people..."
"Tsk tsk... I am broken-hearted..."
"I am Figg."
"Beware how thou dost step! The MageLord is apt to send any transgressor into the pits beneath the Mountains of Freedom."
"Devra and Angus, proprietors of the inn, are my parents. I was born here."
"What tools would a holy man use? Something for blessing people, perhaps... I know not. I must search further for more clues."
"Yes..."*"'Tis a very good price."
"Draygan burned the ship and left the others to die! I know he played a part in the death of mine husband, as well."
"I don't see why thou couldst not speak freely, Zulith."
"Thou shalt find him on the island of Terfin. Ask him about the ring."
"Ask me again, handsome, if thou dost become... thirsty."
"Very well. How much wouldst thou like to bet?"
"Art thou trying to cheat me? Thou dost not have enough gold!"
"Then I must go this one myself," he says angrily. "'Tis no more than one friend would do for another... no more than Bollux did for me!"
"As I say, we have everything thou dost need to have a jolly splendid adventure!"
"The dungeon lies north of town, in the mountains. At the entrance, a Knight named Shmed awaits the hopeful warriors."
"To want to buy what item?"
She bats her eyelashes at you and grins.
The man in the prison greets you with a rather large smile.
"The scroll bears a spell of protection against heat, and should be most useful."
"Our city was named after the beautiful ruler who commissioned the Oracle."
"I am Delin, Fawn's provisioner. Is there something I can do for thee?"
"Oh, it is a modest place -- not like this great masterpiece! A mere cottage."
"Storms unlike any living man hath seen. Storms whose results no man can predict..."
"Devra's a fine woman, for all that she is a bit domineering..."
"I am glad to see that thou art a member. Will I see thee at the next meeting?"
"So where is this ring? How can I tell thee anything about this ring, if thou dost not bring it to me?"
"If times were not so bad, our prices would be far lower..."
"Thou art a fool, Avatar! Thou hast no idea what thou hast lost!"
"To ask if you have reconsidered. The Twin Pillars await the Hero of the Dream."
"My name is Zella."
"He always seems to be hovering about, staring at me. He never seems to be doing anything around the camp."
"No. Then do not ask what deal I give to others. Bad manners."
"To answer thy question, however, I know, or have heard of, many 'people'. Who, in particular, wert thou interested in?"
"How many wouldst thou like?"
"Yes, she's right... it was three months ago."
"Alas master, this one is protected by a power greater than mine. His destiny lies elsewhere."
"Snakes! Why did it have to be snakes? Why could not Lord British have sent thee somewhere akin to 'Daisy Isle' instead?"
"I shall continue in Kylista's place..."
"Hierophant! Thou hast returned!"
"The Goblins are foul but fascinating creatures. They are more intelligent than one would think. In a bestial way, of course."
"To recommend you talk to their leader and their clerk."
"Moreover, the student was in the list fields."
"It has been in Britain for many, many years. It contains historical artifacts, as well as works of art."
"I shall give it to thee when thine hands are not so full."
"Caladin wears his on those brawny arms of his, while Brendann's are kept in more discreet locations..."
Before you is a shrewd-looking craftsman, obviously filled with the contentment of a peaceful life.
"Hahaha! I am the Wantonness Bane!"
"...if thou knowest what I mean, aye?"
"Very well."
"In truth, I believe them to be impostors, though they did answer the question I put to them."
"Many weeks ago a woman named Gwenno passed through Moonshade, and more recently a sage named Batlin."
"A pity we could not teach that little fool a lesson. Perhaps we have anyway. For his sake, he had better have learned it well."
"Not at all, Captain! He had so many questions."
"Hmph. My name is Dell."
"Bees such as these may be tamed with my special arrows!"
"Filbercio is the most powerful wizard of them all."
He takes the contract from you and signs it.
"Oh, it is a pity that thou dost not wish to hear it! It is the funniest one yet and my personal favorite!"
"Thou dost not have enough gold for that!"
"'Tis thee again. Hast thou good news?"
"The signed contract must be seen by me."
"Then thou must be a person of weak character, also."
"Here is thy key."
"Hide! Hide! For the Avatar seeks!"
"How many wouldst thou like?"
"All violence is abhorred by Emps. No killing is desired, even for what you humans call food."
"Aye, treasure... from me wilder, younger days."
"As far as dogs go, he is handsome, too!"
"He came inquiring about ancient ruins, and was especially interested in the Serpent Stone -- but Renfry can tell thee more of this."
"Indeed, thy friend is grievously wounded. Make room here, and I will heal them to the best of mine abilities."
"Why, even Lord British himself will be in attendance! It is a special opportunity when one gets a private audience."
"Forsythe is the mayor. Perhaps thou canst find him in the Town Hall, shouldst thou wish to speak with him."
"Do not worry -- we shall arrest these vermin!"
"Thou speakest rightly. I shall bring my father's murderer to justice or die in the attempt."
"Thou canst blaspheme all thou likest, Olon, I was there and heard it!"
"Thou canst see that my prices are fair..."
"Thou dost not have a spellbook."
"She and Celennia were good friends until Celennia became involved with that Mage."
"The Goblins stormed the walls, and fought their way inside the city. However, the Bears surrounded them, and Gurnordir was at last slain."
"Free them at once!"
Lord British gives you the crystal.
"I believe my carrots are especially tasty. Wouldst thou like to purchase some? They would only cost thee one gold for three."
"Yes, felon?"
"Too bad thou dost not have it with thee. But that is Fawn's luck nowadays!"
"Then thou shalt have them. Here!"
"Our harvest is varied. There are ochre berries in the spring, corn in the summer, and walnuts in the fall."
"Silverleaf trees are Emp homes."
"Do not let him say such things about thee, Avatar!"
You see a tough-looking palace guard who takes his job -very- seriously.
"Now that thou hast completed the Test, I must make a cloak for thee from the skin of the animal thou didst slay."
Paulette turns to face you and smiles coquettishly, "I had thought that thou might return." Her eyes sparkle up at you mischievously.
"Now we know the truth about this town..."
"Please come by if thou wouldst like to rest thy weary feet for the night!"
"Garritt is so talented at the whistle panpipes! It is truly a gift!"
"Though I have heard that Frigidazzi is not always so cool. And I have been told that Filbercio hath not been... faithful... shall we say."
"If thou wouldst travel in a lighter fashion, thou wouldst have hands to take my gold!"
"I am the Mayor of New Magincia, and the wife of Boris."
"I went to open my shop the next morning and there was a bundle of food in place of the Filari Alyssand had put there the night before."
"This type of rock is not common around here. Now if thou didst speak with Krayg, perhaps he could help thee..."
"Another sign that the heavens are displeased with our associations with false prophets!"
"Or... perhaps thou dost shield thine abilities from my senses? Most interesting..."
"Best bloody swill thou wilt eat on the face of the earth!"
"They handle all the horrible little details of running the city. I would be lost without them, 'tis certain."
"I do hope the culprit will be revealed through other methods then."
"My fellow wizards, I am sure that you are able to see beyond this criminal's denials!"
A pinecone from the northern woods.
"There were beatings, and other things... I would rather not talk about that."
"As I have said, I serve and protect my master's household. I do not have time for talk."
"To be interested in spells, reagents, or potions?"
"Instead, speak to one of the Adepts. Perhaps Gustacio, if he'll give thee his ear, or Fedabiblio. They can help thee."
"Well, apparently I hadn't striven hard enough to be deserving of the loan I... acquired from the money box upstairs."
"Mud?! Mud! Back to work! Thou must lack for things to do..."
"Why, today. Thou art in luck. Buy a spell."
"I'm sure there is an explanation for everything."
"To be Aurvidlem. To have become sullen lately, but to know not why."
"He is a good man. The Mayor of Trinsic, he is. I have known him for years."
"We sell all kinds of bows, along with arrows and bolts. If thou dost wish to buy something, please say so!"
"I have a perfect memory for names. 'Twas Badwin, I think. A very large man, with a hooded companion."
Sprellic practically kisses your feet.
"It appears that thou dost not seem to have enough gold to train here. If thou couldst return later after thy pockets are filled..."
"'Tis a shame to see any creature so beautiful placed behind bars, but I think we shall all be safer because of it."
"Then the Hero hath succeeded in destroying the Dream Crystal?"
"Then bother me not! I must be about my duty!"
"Ever since my father died, Caladin hath been my trainer. He is big and loud, and sometimes dumb, but he doth have a good heart."
"But, dear... he is a customer..."
"This is the place!"
"A woodsman like myself would feel uncomfortable travelling with such a large group. I will remain here, instead."
"Wouldst thou like something else?"
"To seem quite healthy!"
"To welcome you back to Terfin."
"Alas -- as is often the case, 'tis not required to understand power to use it."
"Then in the night -- BLAM! Lightning, explosions! The pillar is disintegrated. And this mage is standing there."
"When thou hast finished thy work, then Lord Marsten can preside at thy banquet."
"Lord British brought them from his homeland. They are very foreign to us here in Britannia, but the children enjoy them just the same."
"I must confess, Avatar, that there is a mystery which even I cannot explain."
"It truly isn't so dangerous if thou dost know the secrets. And Shmed is nothing to worry about."
"Thou hast sealed thy fate for no mere mortal can defeat me! Prepare for thy death!"
"Therefore, our ancestors fled the City of Moon in the land British conquered, and sailed until they found this land."
"Thou dost not have my Serpent Staff... Thou must travel to the fiery depths to find where it now lies."
"Yes, master... I mean, no, Master..."
"Very well. Keep thine eye on him. We do not want people popping in and out of our city like this!"
"The land is in dire need of a Hero, for the end of the world draws nigh!"
"To be a provisioner in Vesper."
"My wish is that also. But that is not the wish of Saralek, my wife. Permission from her must first be gained."
"Hast thou done anything exciting lately?"
"Art thou sure thou canst play The Game?"
"Thou mayest buy fine armour from me."
"To have not enough gold for that!"
"This is the Place of Visions, Hero. Thou dost stand on hallowed ground."
"If only there were a way to put thy courage into my metal body..."
"Thou must give me the blood of an ice dragon so I save daughter."
"Thou hast never heard of the Oracle of Beauty?" *"Thou shouldst speak with Kylista at the temple."
He grins, very pleased with himself.
"Hmmm. I wonder if they jumped onto the ship! They could be all the way to Britain by now!"
"The poisoning hath been healed."
"I thank thee for thine ignorance..."
"Though Andral is a Pikeman, I still cannot understand the interest he places in pieces of stone..."
"If thou hast a free moment, I would be quite happy to discuss our philosophy with thee."
"If thou dost call me a thief again, then thou art calling me a liar -- and dishonoring the name of my father!"
"These swirls and dots may seem random, but each has its meaning. A trained artist can read thy past by thy tattoos."
"I have it now."
"So, thou wishes to fight for the cowardly Sprellic! Meet us at the duelling area at next noon!"
"Thou hast found me out! The Oracle is a fraud!"
"Early to bed, early to rise, makes Jack a dull boy."
"I have heard that she believes thee to consort with Daemons, and to be a partner of the one called Batlin."
"Here thou art." Martingo hands you a banana and takes your gold. He turns to 'Lucinda' and whispers, "That rotter took my last banana!"
"Why, I reckon Leavell has broken near as many hearts as I have made stop beating!"
"Thou art carrying too much to take thy payment!"
"The bells are signaling the return of Xenka!"
"What coin wilt thou pay with?"
"Please wear it, and remember me always."
"Thou art mine only hope! Wilt thou please find my daughter Cantra and return her to me?"
"Art thou interested in training? My price is 35 gold for each training session."
"Both sides have stated their facts, and called their witnesses. Let it not be said that there is no justice in Fawn!"
You see your old friend Mariah.
"Please, I beg thee to stop this or thou wilt anger my master...."
Margareta sees your medallion and raises her eyes.
"Thou didst examine the fiery pillar, as Zhelkas instructed thee... And then thou wert gone!"
"Anyway, now that he hath been killed, I know not what we'll do. I suppose we must await the arrival of another ship."
"To keep the Goblet, Hero From Another World. To hope that it might have powers to aid you on your quest."
"Perhaps his cartography would be of aid to thee."
"Thank thee, Avatar! Thank thee for returning to me the Comb of Beauty. Take this key..."
"I be Clint."
"Hello, stranger. I am Andral of Monitor. Dost thou need the services of a master artist?"
"One that bakes. One that sews. One that smiths. All from Torrissio. They work hard... do not talk back like Topo."
"What dost thou wish, Master?"
"We do not trust magic -- thou couldst not sell a magical weapon in this town at any price! Yet there are powers greater than mere magic..."
"Quen spends just about all of his time in the Keg Of Spirits tavern, near the ferry dock."
"How do we know this to be true? I say that he lies!"
"Women are fickle! Never give thine heart to one of their kind, stranger. Better to love them and then leave them..."
"She was merely our pawn -- a pretty thing, clever in a limited way, but always our tool."
"Thou wilt have to cage them again, as they were before Batlin came. 'Tis only a temporary solution at best."
"What dost thou have there? Why, 'tis moving..."
"If thou desirest to know more, I would suggest speaking with Caladin. He is the instructor for young Knight candidates."
"Rotoluncia was quite repulsed yet fascinated with Batlin and his secrets. To think of it makes me wish to offer thee a word of advice."
"I did not want to do it. She seduced me into trying to kill thee! Yet even now, I cannot betray her..."
"In which circle of magic art thou interested?"
"Thou canst sing along if thou wishest..."
"Pumice is a light, rough rock of a black or light brown hue."
"How may I help thee? As a Ranger, I must help thee in any way that I can."
"Jendon was right to send thee to me. I doubt that anyone else in Fawn takes much notice of such things..."
"Perhaps another spell?"
"Here is thy payment."
"If thou shouldst come across a way off this island please permit us to leave with thee."
"Thou canst hardly miss the List Field -- 'tis the walled field in the south part of town."
"Some other time, then."
"I do believe thou dost not have enough monetari. Please return when thou dost have the appropriate amount."
"Thou dost not have enough gold for that!"
"I have paid thee once for thy delivery. I shall not do so again."
"I am not a sociable man, so this will be brief. What dost thou desire of me, and at what price?"
"I have my lute with me..."
"Come to my shop during business hours."
"We have found the real traitors!"
"Thou hast a talent for bargaining. I will accept this price."
"Look at the new Knight! Thou dost certainly look fetching with thy tattoo. Hah!"
Emotion immediately grips your heart to see such a beautiful young woman seem so sad.
"I'd be a mason and lay them in style!"
"Thou must come by the shoppe when it is open!"
"I cannot recall any of the women wearing slippers like thou hast described."
"There is a song about the other castle, as well." ~"Wouldst thou care to hear it?"
"It hath been a pleasure!" *"I will accept thine offer."
"The good bard was very disturbed by thy sudden departure, and hath been questioning the Mages constantly as to thy fate."
"Whom dost thou wish to heal?"
"The Champion Knight of Monitor is the one who hath won the right to wear the Helm of Courage."
The engagement ring belonging to Alyssand of Fawn.
"There are three bodies of Knights in the city. No Command is better than another, for all warriors are equal."
"Yes, Captain. I asked a favor of him, to deliver a document for me."
"Perhaps Yurel will never know. Perhaps Yurel will never live to see home again. Yurel is lonely... and hungry."
"Whom I threw out of town..."
"Gustacio hath asked that I join the Council in this troubled time, and I have done so."
"And who are you? My master?"
"Condolences to thee, Delin, and apologies if we have been unfeeling."
"The writings of Xenka speak of the Three which shall travel with thee. Without them, thou canst not succeed."
"Well if it isn't Dupre! -Sir- Dupre now, is it?"
The gargoyle, a contented grin on his face, greets you with a handshake.
"Thou hath solved all of mine riddles. Doth thou wish to hear them again?"
"I am a knight here in Serpent's Hold. 'Tis my job to help protect the citizens of Britannia."
"Do not be hasty, Avatar! I can only speak to thee this once! Art thou sure that thou dost understand all that I have said?"
"Thou dost not have any vials of venom!"
"And I am jealous of her affections, as well. I have found that women are notoriously fickle..."
"What wouldst thou like to buy?"
"May Beauty lay their souls to rest..."
"And that is 'Mister' Gordy, to thee!"
"Return when my shop is open, and we can talk business."
You see an attractive middle-aged woman with music in her eyes.
"That is a bear skull. Bears are commonly found in the south and west portions of our land."
"I work with C-C-Cubolt, f-f-farming here."
"He is in charge of the Hold when I am otherwise occupied. He has seemed somewhat changed of late, but I trust him nonetheless."
"Mine half-sister and I have no job but to serve our quest."
"But it hath been hard on Cantra. A girl at her age needs a father, dost not thou agree?"
"These rocks are formed when the Primal Forces of Fire and Earth collide -- during certain conjurations, for instance."
"How many pairs of leather leggings wouldst thou like to sell?"
"Voldin doth not count -- he is an animal. What I need is companionship..."
"Definitely do not look like anything that a Mage would have lost. They have much more expensive tastes..."
"Said his name was Batlin. Came to town askin' about the Daemon artifacts hereabouts. Bothering poor Delin..."
"Hmm. Too crowded for my liking. Come back if thou shouldst diminish thy group by a member or two."
"To make another purchase?"
"I look forward to thy return."
"Very well. I shall need the scroll to give thee further information."
"Kylista is the Priestess of Beauty. Ta her falls the duty of keeping Fawn on the path of Beauty through these dark days."
Gargan wipes his runny nose on his sleeve.
"A hall of sleeping gargoyles..."
"I did already give thee all the Varo leaves that I have! Thou must go to Harnna to heal thine infection!"
"Thou couldst ask a scholar or some such... Perhaps even a mage might be able to help. I don't know."
"Another time, perhaps."
"As thy wish. I shall start again with Rhys..."
"Dost thou accept?"
"There are storms which lash out with magical lightnings, and strange illnesses which plague the innocent."
"I knew that if I did not promise to return that these laggard monks would drift away from the task I set them."
"Lucilla hath prepared this feast, the main dish of which includes meat from the wolf which thou didst slay in the Knight's Test."
"No? What hast thou been doing? -Loaf-ing around? Ha ha ha!"
"Oh... I'm not used to standing in public like this... crowds make me nervous..."
"Well... All right. But I did not like thee telling me to leave!"
"Here they are."
"To have known him for many years, but not as long as Cairbre. To be good friend."
Rowena's eyes begin to look a little glassy and she blinks slowly as if entering a deep trance.
"Wouldst thou like another spell?"
"To be sure that your friends are hasty in your behalf."
"Now I go into the Void!"
"It seems we are fated to be together..."
"The Knights of Monitor each serve a particular commmand. Each command espouses its own unique military strategy."
"I will be of more use to thee if I remain here. I seem to have a talent for finding the information thou dost need."
"This place is horrible. Wouldst thou be so kind as to take me to mine husband, Trent? He has a tendency to worry about me."
"To know this is not all -- to become worse with time, until the End of the World. Unless the Hero prevails."
The man before you shyly looks away.
"This is so embarrassing. To think that I could have had any man in this town, and yet I gave mine heart to... Spektor!"
"If he doth not have time for thee, perhaps he could allow thee to satisfy thy curiosity in the library of magics."
"Ah, but thou art a strong warrior! I have an idea."
"Wouldst thou like something else?"
"I don't trust that weakling Krayg, but if he says to look for evidence in the woods, perhaps thou shouldst."
"Canst thou not find the spirits of the town?"
"That is how we fed our people, and how we traded with the other towns."
"Thou art already well-versed in the tactics of the battlefield. I am afraid that I am unable to train thee further in this."
"For all that he is Devra's son, he is still a dog!"
"The blackrock is working! I no longer feel the painful ether!"
"That is how Zhelkas referred to it, Avatar. Perhaps it is a test of thy skill or versatility as a warrior."
"Thou dost look like thou dost need a good drink!"
"For the purpose of this trial, it hath been necessary to admit certain disreputable characters into the city --"
"My fellow Lords are Rotoluncia and Gustacio."
"Um... well, I am not sure. Perhaps Dupre or Shamino might know."
"I do not believe that we have met. 'Tis so nice to make the acquaintance of a new, young Mage."
"Send thy men to arrest Lord Marsten! I have evidence that he is our traitor!"
"'Tis a wonder that Filbercio hath not died of frostbite by now! I cannot discern if he's a brave man... or merely stupid!"
"Who art thou, stranger? Why can't I see thee? Curse this Imbalance which veils my mind..."
"And who will stop me, hag? Thou?"
"I can give thee 20 gold coins for every 1 gold nugget thou hast."
"Dost thou not see? Red, green and yellow -- and we have observed their properties. Now we can report to Gustacio."
"Return to Knight's Test, and bring me the slain wolf. Or else thou canst not achieve thy knighthood!"
"It is not time! I must have the full 24 hours!"
Lord British studies you a moment.
"If thou hast spoken to each of us and hast determined that one of us is guilty, accuse accordingly. But be not hasty in thy judgment."
"Of course. I understand. Thou dost have much more important matters to resolve. I will call for an official from Yew to handle this issue."
"I listened to the words of traitors and turned out good men, barring them from my protection!"
"Thou mayest find this hard to believe, but my dreams tell me that thy sojourn in Fawn hath been of benefit to thy quest."
"Only the toughest Goblin chiefs wear the Gwani cloak. And only the toughest Knights can slay such a fearsome Goblin!"
"Sounds like a love story to me..."
"He can out-drink any man in this town, and I think he could out-fight nearly everyone except Jorvin!"
"Perhaps Luther is right! As provisioner, Krayg could obtain many kinds of bottles..."
"That be Christopher's son. Nice lad."
"Someone hath sent thee to me, eh? Well, I shall try to be of help to thee. What dost thou inquire about?"
"Enough bragging. Humility. Thou must learn humility.@"
"Thine hands are full!"
"How might I be of service to thee?"
"I am an orphan. I have no name. My parents were so poor they could not afford to give me one!"
"Oh, Yurel is so happy! Thou art kind, kind, kind! The ball is yours... But be careful of the warriors, they are looking for it."
"Columna is the Green Enchantress' name. And thou wouldst be amazed by her spell..."
"Surrender those stockings to me."
"It has not yet been a full week. The Amulet of Balance has not fully recharged."
"It looks important, though I am no judge of such things. Thou shouldst come look while thou hast the chance..."
"Murder? In Trinsic?" The ruler looks concerned.~~"I have heard nothing about it. Art thou investigating it?"
"Hmm... not bad looking!"
"I would remind our Fellowship guests that they are here on sufferance, and that they should mind their manners."
"I don't like to boast, but I daresay there is no better riddlemaster than myself! Art thou sure thou doth want to play?"
"My name is Edrin."
"I'll not cross... without proper payment."
"'Tis a pity to see her so undone. I hope that thou canst find a way to restore her to her proper state of mind soon."
"An' they'll not eat thy tongue, either... 'Tis too tough from overuse!"
The magic armour type is almost twice as effective in protecting thee as the antique one.
"I see... Perhaps thou couldst have pleaded insanity and avoided being sent here, felon."
"Give the Orb to me, and thou shalt have a most peculiar reward -- the Whistle of Doskar."
"Oh. Well, carry on with thine investigation."
"She's a Hor-ti-culturist, Olon. Thou shouldst only give facts..."
"A disagreeable fellow. Travelled with some very rough sorts. He was seeking Daemon artifacts, I believe."
"It still lies between Britain and Trinsic, but it has grown further into Britain itself."
"How can she abide that fellow Ruggs? He is so confounded ugly..."
"But first, thou must bring me the Hearts of three Ice Worms."
"Daughter can be saved! I thank thee."
"Please come to the shop when it is open."
"I would join with thee, old friend, but I can see that thou already hast a large party."
"Tell me -- hast thou obtained the plant which I told thee of? The King's Savior?"
"I do not believe that a rogue like thyself hast the riches to buy Hawk's freedom! What canst thou give us?"
"I can give thee 3 guilders for every 4 filari thou hast."
"And heavens know that I'm patient enough... dealing with my slug of a Master!"
"I am an Emp. Saralek is an Emp. Salamon is an Emp. You," he smiles, "are a human."
"She also has a moonsilk sleeping gown, which cost more guilders than I shall ever make!"
"Then watch this, my love..."
"They are all seamen who have been appointed to their post in recognition of their expertise."
"Who? Never heard of thee."
"I'm a funny boy!" Max laughs hysterically. "Makth sing too!"
"Perhaps. Yet to me, this doth have the stench of a Moonshadian intrigue."
"How much wouldst thou like to bet?"
"The Ice Worms are found in the cold northern lands, I am told. I have not been there myself. Heard stories. Very cold."
"Thou dost not have that much gold! Mayhaps thou couldst return with more and purchase the service then."
"Welcome ta Fawn. I am Great Captain Joth. Thou canst call me Joth." *"'Tis always a pleasure ta meet a Pikeman."
"Thou dost want to join me in the Community Room?"
"She is very vise and knows many things but vhen I asked her if I should go back to The Fellowship or stay with them she did not answer me."
A bottle of that excellent vintage of wine sold by the Rangers of Moonshade. Why, I should sample some now...
"The Oracle actually speaks -- all of us have heard it. It speaks in reply to the Priestess of Beauty."
"This must have been left by a Man. At last -- evidence to identify our traitor!"
"It is thee again!"
"The cost is 8 gold coins per person. Wouldst thou like a room for the night?"
"Yes, thou art!"
"Since I am a member of thy group, I shall train thee for free!"
"We must hasten to the Serpent Gate!"
"Yes, thou mayest tell me thy name," she says, glancing around the building. "Are not the many books beautiful?"
"'Tis simply beyond belief that she would have poisoned thee... yet thou dost say she confessed to her crime."
"To have little to tell you..."
"Where hast thou taken me, Avatar?!"
"Oh, he was some old pirate with a temper. He's probably dead now, if he knows what's good for him!"
"I haven't a clue, except that I'm here doing all of the work, and he's not."
"As a token of my gratitude, please accept this, the Scroll of the Serpent."
"The City of Beauty hath become the City of Blood and Ruin. Only I am left alive."
"One year I was chosen to sing in the chorus, and we followed behind him, tossing flower petals and singing the Hymns of Chaos."
You see a battle-scarred old soldier.
"I think thou art merely trying to cheer me. For this, I thank thee, but nothing can fill an empty heart."
This is a lovely, earthy woman with a warm smile.
"The Great Lady did flee Fawn in a terrible hurry, due to the Curse. All she left behind was her Diamond Necklace."
"Do not worry -- I shall personally see that Marsten is hunted down like the dog he is."
"Look into my crystal ball. Thou shalt find it on the table within mine home. Let thy mind be clear."
"Neyobi sickness gone! Avatar cure Neyobi. Myauri never forget great deed Avatar do for Myauri. Great deed for Gwani people!"
"Very well. Come to me if thou changest thy mind."
"When Shamino the Anarch took over, he cast Filbercio out of the Palace and made him a beggar."
"Thou art a fine one to talk! Work! Or I shall rip out thy tongue!"
"My fee will leave thee with nothing!"
"Did I tell thee about the islands of cats?"
"My name is Boydon."
"They are thine once again."
"Thou must prepare for thy banquet."
"Go back ta washin' the glasses, Jendon! Thou art no judge of what a darin' adventurer like this 'ere lad might like ta hear."
"I have loved close-quarter fighting since I was old enough to grasp my first spear. That's why I moved to Yew."
"These people are the hermits I spoke of before."
"Mighty nice of him, I say. He looks to be a good lad. Doth he need a wife?"
"What can I sell to thee?"
"To be too heinous a plot for Runeb." He frowns. "To be some kind of bad joke."
"When thou hast become a Knight, I can be of service to thee. Until then, be thou gone."
"May I see the bottle?"
"Very well. How much wouldst thou like to bet?"
"If so I do not find it funny! Thou art not playing a game, fool! Go, and do not return until thou hast completed thy promised task!"
"Could he be speaking of Iolo's wife, the good lady Gwenno?"
"Doth not sound like anything I ever heard of."
"But perhaps thou wilt have need of me yet..."
"As a result, The Baths and The House of Games are two of the most profitable establishments in the country."
"Since I am travelling in thy group, I shall waive my fee."
"Thou hast not enough gold for my rooms."
"Perhaps I could find another song for thee..."
"I discovered poor Christopher and Inamo earlier this morning. I did not touch a thing. Made me sick, it did!"
"See the balance slipping In the fight between ill and good. Thou shalt walk the beam To find the treasure thou seekest."
"What wouldst thou like to buy?"
"As thou hast probably guessed, I am especially good with female students... But thou shouldst ask me of this another time."
You see a rotund older gentleman, who is at once humble yet dignified. His gentle eyes exude caring for his fellow person.
"I can give thee 4 filari for every 3 guilders thou hast."
"To request something else?"
You see a beggar leaning on a crutch. His eyes shine like diamonds with sheer bitterness.
A while later, after the woman has shown you more tricks than a mage on stage, you emerge from the Community Room a much happier Avatar.
"Stay here as long as thou wishest, friend."
"War is both holy and obscene, beautiful and yet hideous. I love it. I am very good at it."
"Dost thou agree?"
"I am afraid thou dost not have enough to pay for this..."
"I know thee! Thou art the adventurer for whom the MageLord held the banquet."
"This is no time to sleep! Look alive!"
"She rarely has time for visitors, but I know she takes on students every now and then."
"Should I selfishly ask that mine own Beauty be restored when the life's blood of Fawn -- the city of Beauty -- lies dead in the streets?!"
"Indeed, the wench hath confessed to her crime!"
Day 56: We are wedged in by an icefloe. Food is running low.
"To join you is his desire?"
"Now I shall have to find myself another shield..."
You see a small man with twisted, sloped posture. He looks you up and down before deciding he will speak to you.
"And now, Priestess, please continue thy witness."
"It sounds like the object thou art describing may be a funeral urn."
"If thou art certain..."
"If thou dost wish to know the mystery of that object, the answer is simple."
"Thou art truly as brave as Edrin pictured thee! I can tell thee how to defeat Rabindrinath..."
"He pledged his heart and sailed away Never to return again."
"What I need is to talk to her specter and see if I can wring any sense out of her rather than these writings!"
"'Twas to be an instrument of truth... I cannot say that that is still so."
"He is a great archer who resides in the forest. He moved here to get away from the far-too-quickly growing towns."
"Oh, the beauty of pure Chaos! 'Tis the unity of all the discordant elements of Nature, without pattern or order."
"I would ask about them at the Inn of Sleeping Bull if I were thee."
"I believe she was referring to thee!"
"Topo is the unfortunate boy that Master Ducio took for an apprentice. He's the one that does all the work at the shop."
"For instance, take young Freli. His father was a shopkeeper. What could a merchant teach his son about magical powers!"
"This person is a lout, my dear. Cast the fool out the door."
"Yes, indeed. He came into the Broken Oar -- most people do, thou knowest. Asked me a great number of questions."
Ophelia motions you closer to her. She whispers to you. "Sprellic can call upon the Avatar to come and be his champion." She nods solemnly.
"Thou cannot carry that much!"
"I am the Shade Blade. My destiny is to serve thee until we are..." The sword pauses, "parted."
"The females of our race are exceedingly willful, yet they lack common sense. Without men to dominate them, they would ruin everything."
"Hello. Uhm, art thou sure thou dost not really want to speak with Wench or Martine?"
"Her healing skills are said to be unparalleled."
"That is what we call Caine. He is the alchemist who created the fire."
"To be pleased... To bid you to go to the Pillars of Purity."
"There is simply no profit in selling spells..."
"Good! Then with time, perhaps, we could learn to like thee."
"I do not approve of jokes."
"Frigidazzi specializes in cold-related spells. She is a great beauty, but she is rather cold to everyone."
She takes the banner from you.
"Ho, Avatar!" says Gorn. "Thou dost vish to speak mit me?"
"Please make up thy mind!"
"Thou art an apprentice, boy! Thou dost not work with me. Thou dost work for me! Understand?"
"I am the High Court official at the prison here in the Abbey."
"To see you need more experience to train at this time."
"Here it is."
"Kylista is the priestess of Beauty."
"We do not have city gates to hide behind."
"No! I did not ask that! I do not want to know!"
"And I'd bet thou dost need a drink, right?"
"To breathe again. To be alive!"
"I probably should not speak of sacred matters to outsiders, but it is true that the Ashes of the Dead are holy."
"But first, thou must free us."
"What! Thou art accusing me! Preposterous. I had nothing to do with it!"
"Ha! Now there is a fine jest, if ever I heard one!"
"Filbercio promised me a small but substantial fortune if I could procure a certain pair of moonsilk stockings."
"I am cheered in that thou dost like it..."
"Then thou canst not enter the underground city."
"Then how did he appear in the middle of the funeral? Doth he fly?"
"I tried to save Captain Hawk from the Anarch, but my powers were not sufficient."
"If there is time after the Game, perhaps thou canst join me. If I can carry it... Perhaps I'll bring thee something."
Tobias looks at you as if he thinks you are a bit dim.
"I am so happy my daughter hath been found, resurrected by the monks, and that thou hast restored her mind."
"So be it then!" ~"Prepare thyself to be thrashed!"
"The ashes... place the Ashes on the altar."
"I am the Master of the Great Northern Forest, and none can dispute it."
"We must take back the Helm of Monitor, and avenge the death of Astrid!"
"One was a pirate, by his looks, with an unearthly white eye."
"Which coin dost thou care to exchange for filari?"
"Anything else for thee today?"
"To find the Dream Crystal, thou must venture into Rabindrinath's Keep somewhere within the Dream Realm."
"I am the armourer of the Hold."
"I would give Fawn's greatest treasure if only I could find the Comb of Beauty!"
"Thou hast not the room for this sack."
"It doth sound like some sort of pot. Perhaps Topo could aid thee -- he assists Master Ducio in fashioning bowls and pots for the Mages."
"Ah, that lovely girl is the barmaid of the Keg Of Spirits tavern, down by the ferry dock."
"To want what item?"
"So, hurry!"
"Oh, 'tis a rotten egg! Leave here with that!"
"A bedroll! With this, thou wilt sleep well anywhere."
"So, I am sure that she would take quite an interest in that fat mage's pet daemon. I wish I could send her word..."
"Thou dost dare to confront me? Thou, that didst bring the blasphemer to Lady Yelinda!"
"Thy companions and thee look fit enough for an informal practice session. Consider it a demonstration of my fighting style."
"I watch over the Royal Nursery. I am the nanny of these wonderful children."
"Wouldst thou please ask thy minions to depart?"
"What spell dost thou wish to buy?"
"Unfortunately, it was stolen from me years ago."
"From Aimi I have heard that he is brilliant, and... also a bit overzealous to instruct those interested in increasing their knowledge."
"Be that as may be, Olon. 'Tis not some bar maid that thou art speakin' with. Some of thy tales are not fit for any but a sailor's ears."
"Do that, and quiet! Thou art rude to interrupt."
You see a large man with an almost cunning, erudite aura about him.
"Thou dost not have enough gold, eh? Too bad."
"Close thy trap, Voldin, or I'll scratch thine eyes out!"
"I have always been well-connected -- even before I took a seat on the Council. Many Mages come to consult me during their research."
"Please go and recover it then. I believe it contains information that may help my companion."
"Thou shouldst not waste my time so! I am a busy man!"
"Very well. How 'bout if I just say that I was born in a cave, so my mother named me Mole."
"'Tis a shame I must charge high prices like this."
"Thou hast found the locket!"
"Donal was Angus' father. He was a good, hard-working man."
"How many gems wouldst thou like to sell?"
"To wonder what happened to those who once dwelt here..."
"Didst thou fight a dragon as well? She is full of jests."
"I am Delin, Fawn's provisioner. Forgive me if thou dost already know me..."
"Idiot! Dost thou not think that I recognize the after-effects of the Dance of Passion?!"
"Until the monument was to be built and now these murders I believed this town to be a good place to live."
Meryl drifts off stage, leaving Dustin alone.
"My purpose is to spread love dust all around and welcome thee to Ambrosia! I love thee! Yes, I do!"
"To apologize, but to ask you to return when I am open."
"Should I spend that hour in profitless combat, solely to please my fellow Knights? I think not."
"To request how many?"
"We serve nothing pretentious, but it fills the belly and warms the soul."
"Take care that thou dost not seek to play me for the fool!"
"Thou dost know my name, but I still do not know the name of thee. I like to know to whom I am speaking. What is thy name?"
"Thou shouldst speak to Monk Draxta, if thou desirest to perceive the mystery of Xenka."
"And if thou dost meet me at my barracks at next midnight, I shall show thee another way to spar..."
"Which of you wishes to train?"
"And I do not doubt that she could... and would!"
Gargan coughs, wheezes, and then lights his pipe. On inhaling, he has a coughing spasm until he finally catches his breath.
"To be female as the Hero was in the dream..."
"Thou wilt find no better rates..."
"Edrin hath thought thee kind... I see that he was misled."
"He hath been the only thing that hath kept us all sane since we have been stranded here."
"Astrid was such a person. When I become the Knight Champion and the Helm is recovered, I shall wear it in Astrid's memory."
You see an old woman who gives you a smile of grandmotherly sweetness. You can see immediately that her vision is poor.
"I expect we could find him at Gustacio's manor."
"To be the city in which you are located. To be the city of gargoyles."
"Astrid was a brave woman. But the next Champion Knight shall be me."
"He hath been most delighted lately -- as if some burden hath been lifted from his mind."
"Dost thou wish to test thy mettle by taking the Test of Knighthood?"
"He is a genius. Perhaps the greatest military mind that ever lived. He told us so!"
"Good service and fair prices is what hath made the Blue Boar famous!"
"How interesting."
"Thou art a fine one to talk, thou bilge-water rat!" ~"Thou wouldst hold an honest merchant hostage to thy drinking sprees!"
"But when the sailors began spouting that Fellowship nonsense, Kylista did right, orderin' their contagion outside the city walls."
"Well, if that is the way thou dost feel... Go thou. Prove thyself worthy! Go on!"
"Not any old item -- it must be something which reflects the soul of the lost one! Something personal, something of the heart."
"...And I believed him, which shows thee how gullible I am!"
"Before thou dost depart, let me show thee a few of my trinkets. Here is my..."
"Bah! Take that to Bull and exchange it for true money -- like Monetari!!!"
"Donal took over the inn and nothing more untoward happened until Theron disappeared."
"I told thee I am good! May I join?"
"Why, thou art right, sailor. Nevertheless, I stand by my sworn testimony!"
"$Temp2Flag was set to true."
"Truly. I think I shall never understand humans."
"'Tis a long story, but to be brief, Columna the Green Witch hated me for what I did. She is dead now, but her curse lives on."
"I doubt that he shall even deign to speak with thee. He is of the old school, and speaks only to those he considers worthy of his time."
"I can give thee 10 monetari for every 1 gold nugget thou hast."
"Avatar, may I tell thee a secret?"
"I would share more with thee, but I think that thou dost not appreciate it. Besides, I must clean this foulness!"
"I am not in trouble, am I?" ~"I did not do anything!"
"Yelinda is the embodiment of all of Fawn itself. Because Kylista presides over the Oracle, she is the personification of Beauty."
"I was in the Seminarium when the Glowing Man came. Fedabiblio tried to stop him, but could not..."
"Such visitors are rare, for the journey here is not an easy one. As I remember it, Gwenno was our last visitor."
"I hate charging such prices, but times are hard..."
"Thou dost already have that spell!"
You tell Elynor that it was found at the murder site. Elynor registers surprise.
"Thou art ready, young Knight! Go to the banquet hall in one hour. I shall meet thee there."
"Mad Iolo, he doth call himself now! His eyes are all afire, and he doth act like a man possessed."
"Permission from Salamon must be gained first. Then permission from me will be granted. Your return to me is necessary for that."
"Then I can do nothing for thee. Unseen evidence is useless evidence."
"Let us bring this world to its knees! Let these pitiful mortals worship us... even as they die!"
"The Rangers became his instruments of chaos... Anything was allowed, as long as one held a 'permit' from the Anarch."
"How canst thou say that? I thought that thou wert my sister? Thou art a traitor!"
"As thou hast no doubt noted, our tattoos mark us according to our Command."
"I know my son. I know that he is growing up unhappy. But I cannot believe that he would steal things."
"Why, yes. After I find my brother we will return home, if possible. It will be much safer to travel by ship."
"It resembled a bird, but it was not a bird!"
"To desire another item?"
"Mages use reagents and such like to cast magic. The good or ill of it comes from the caster's intent."
You see an unkempt, yet dapper man talking to himself.
"I am Leon, a speaker for The Fellowship and former farmer."
"Then there was the culturist -- her name was, uh..."
"I may be drunk, but I'm not stupid..."
"Wouldst thou care for something else?"
"I can give thee 30 guilders for every 1 gold nugget thou hast."
"Thou art welcome to it."
"Ducio is a Master Artisan. His work is incredibly good -- when he does any work at all."
"What is this scroll? By the blazes of Furnace! This is proof!"
"I have not always been as thou dost see me now. I have spent a lifetime becoming worthy of this honor."
"But if thou dost ask me, she's too gruff -- I think she'd like to give everyone orders, if she could."
"How many dost thou want to purchase?"
"The storms stripped us of our ships, one by one."
"Thou art worthless."
"Oh, forgive my manners! Wouldst thou like a banana?"
"What wouldst thou like to buy?"
"Look at how quickly it has grown! It looks as if it has been here for decades!"
"Very well! I shall join with thee."
"If thou wouldst have some way of getting us back to Buccaneer's Den, Master Robin would reward thee handsomely."
"Reef the sails an' hang on! There be one of those damned storms a bearin' down on us! Heavens help us!"
"He is fond of long walks, and sometimes he discovers odd rocks and plants. He brings me mandrake roots sometimes."
"How many wouldst thou like?"
"May I see it? Ah, thank thee..."
"Plagued by goblins and treachery vile, The old king went too far."
Within my pages lie the bridges to the great chasms. When thou dost reach the great pillars, stand between them and read my words once more.
"Thou art too burdened to carry any more money."
"The Fellowship teaches people to follow their leaders like sheep. Canst thou think of better guidance?"
"I was, am, and shall be the Court...Fool! I could give thee a clue if I wish, but for now my job is to play The Game."
"To waste our precious time! To leave now!"
"Thou art carrying too many things to take thy fish and chips from me!"
"Thou hast not the weapon to defeat him! His powers overwhelm thee, and thou dost die!"
"M'name's Kane. I be a sheepherder..."
"Thou shalt learn more about them in due time."
"But I would rather discuss Zelda."
"Thou art as bad as those horrible wizards from Moonshade! No respect for life!"
"But thou art already a member, Avatar! One can only join once!"
"Go to mine home. There thou shalt find a crystal ball. Gaze into it, and let thy mind be clear."
"I might ask how thou didst come by this. But I won't. I do not want to know. Vasculio hath been dead for years..."
"What better servants to have? Automatons can exist for centuries without any maintenance at all."
"Bah! If they had their way, the Wolves would waste all our men defending the highways, and leave Monitor defenseless!"
"I wouldn't have believed it... thou didst beat me... in a fair fight..."
"What manner of beast art thou, to carry such things with thee?!"
"No doubt we shall be in many strange dungeons before our adventure is over..."
"Soon I shall rival the Guardian himself and crush thee like the irritating insect thou art!"
"I am the Mayor's clerk. I am responsible for keeping track of official records and documents in Vesper."
"Fenn and me have been friends since we were little tiny babes."
"We have had some good memories, have we not, Henry?"
"I need not bore thee with the details of how I learned of this power. Suffice it to say that I cannot die."
"Wilt thou accept?"
"'Twas a large serpent jawbone that my mentor received from his mentor, the Mad Mage."
"We have no maps to aid thee, I fear. But I know that there is a book describing the old temples here in the abbey."
"Thou art the man of my dreams! I have never felt so fulfilled. What an experience..."
"If thou wouldst wish the honest truth, I do not think that my beloved Keth will ever come back from wherever that storm took him."
"Now what was that man's name? It was a simple name, unpleasant sounding and mean..."
"Perhaps Ernesto at the Winery could help thee. 'Tis said that he is good with weapons and such."
"The Helm doth have mystical powers, which we believe are due to being imbued with the essence of Courage."
"This is unthinkable! Surely there hath been some mistake!"
"The Knights are organized into three war bands, which are known as Commands -- the Bears, the Wolves, and the Leopards."
"Thou must also seek three artifacts -- a Ring, a Necklace, and an Earring."
"Yes..."*"'Tis a very good price."
"Your wish is for me to travel with you?"
"We are attacked again! Now that we have the gold, I think that it is time for me to use my Blink Ring to escape."
"Dost thou agree to my rate?"
"Very good. Nothing like a little business transaction to take my mind off the ghastly scene in the stables."
"I have heard that thy friend hath been taken prisoner, to be placed on trial before the Oracle."
"I have beaten thee!"
"Oooh, he is such a wonderful man, dost thou not think? He is so intense and serious. Handsome, too! Oh, and I like Regal as well."
"It was I that found the passages that told of thy coming."
"To be very friendly. To be called Quan."
"Great Captain Garth doth have plans laid for rebuilding the ships. But 'twould not be safe until these storms subside."
"Thou shouldst ask Ernesto if he recognizes it. He is the arms expert among the Rangers."
"There are some who say that when it comes to music, we automatons have a tin ear."
"Thou cannot possibly carry that much!"
Be frugal and be prodigal.
"How can I help thee, Great Captain?"
"I have seen Battles has reflexes faster than a snake."
"Ah, one of Monitor's female Pikemen. I am Zulith, Chancellor of Fawn. It is mine honor and duty to serve thee."
"What has happened? Hast thou lost the package?"
"When a Knight dies, his body must be brought back to Monitor for cremation. The ashes are then placed in the Crypts."
"I only wish we knew more than what Commander Isstanar had to tell us when he arrived a few weeks ago."
She died forlorn.
"I had not expected to be called to witness, Captain Voldin. After all, I serve Lady Yelinda. Much of what I know is confidential."
"Hierophant, here is thy Serpent Sceptre!"
"Thou wilt find no other moneychangers with such a low fee as mine!"
"I can give thee 300 guilders for any piece of jewelry thou hast."
"Hello again!"
"It is a test which one must endure alone, without companions."
"Thou dost not have enough gold for that!"
"Perhaps this has something to do with the magical storms? Perhaps we are all in danger!"
"If I can discern how to reverse the teleportation, perhaps I can rescue poor Mortegro. I hope he was not killed in the exchange..."
"Forgive me, I thought I had already introduced myself. I am Lady Yelinda."
"I would not be surprised if the suit of armor forgot entirely about it."
"My price is 20 gold for each training session. Art thou still interested?"
This young, lovely tavern wench is sexy and sweet.
"Ah, yes. We sometimes find these on the beach after a storm."
"Thou dost need a spellbook!"
"For the most part, they are simple platitudes that further ingrain their reverence of Beauty."
"Why, as a matter of fact..."
"Look. See how porous the handle is... This definitely isn't wood. And I don't think it would last with strenuous use."
"As thou wishest..."
"Forgive me for denouncing thee, stranger. I was under compulsion from the Great Captains, and had no choice."
"A thousand thanks! I had feared that I would remain an adornment of this place forever, thanks to Shamino the Anarch."
"Next, thou must place the Banes upon the altars of Chaos. Thou must place each Bane upon the altar which is dedicated to its native Force!"
"I fear that thou dost already know this one..." ~"Wouldst thou like to hear it again?"
The Mayor hands you 100 gold coins.
"I fight harder than any man or woman alive. I commonly win, but when I do not, the victor knows that they were in a terrific fight."
"If thou dost wish it, then I shall accompany thee. Perhaps the danger shall cause me to forget my grief."
"Several days ago we were camped in a nearby cave when we were attacked by a terrible sorceress."
"I do not know what changes were made after I left, Avatar. But perhaps this will help."
"Hello, again," Chantu says. "How may I help thee?"
"What is this all about, Captain Jorvin?"
"Together... together... until the fiery, peaceful end! Now enemies... once friends!"
"I am Delphynia, horticulturist and healer. State thy business or be on thy way. I do not traffic with oafs and knaves."
"Without the Mandrake Roots, I can do nothing for thee."
"Then mayest thou find more inexpensive training elsewhere."
"Give it time. Perhaps three moons. And then the people will clamor for the old ways, and remember Voldin in his jail cell."
"Better... better... but I think perhaps thou dost need a prop."
"The Britannian Mining Company produces a wide variety of minerals that are essential to the continuation of progress in Britannia."
"Bucia charges a fillip more on everything she sells, for her troubles. And is very careful to show Flindo the altered accounts."
"'Tis an old inn. As old as Monitor itself. I can gladly accommodate thee if thou dost wish."
"And how many pairs of plate leggings wouldst thou care to sell?"
"Gustacio and I are engaged in studies of the strange teleport storms that have been afflicting our land."
"We shall take her lifeless body to Monk Isle, where perhaps we can restore life where death doth now reign."
"Returned again?"
"Well now, there be plenty of those here. Who dost thou wish ta know about?"
"Pay the price, the Philanderer's Friend, and I shall reward thee!"
"Here is a tooth that will enable thee to travel to another place."
"No job is had by me. Food is gathered by me."
"I am qualified to heal, cure poison, and resurrect. Art thou interested in one of these services?"
"Leave him alone, Luther."
"It is said they have several games of chance there! Gold can be won wagering on the outcome of a race of fine stallions."
"Good. I will let you continue talking to me then! Which do you prefer, my living room or my bedroom?"
"He is the captain of the guards. I would have no other for his position. He is the most honorable warrior I have ever met."
"Thou cannot possibly carry that much!"
"Thy good health, sir. Many campaigns sit upon thy brow. It is an honor."
"Since thou hast brought it back, Monitor shall surely never fall."
"Thou must have some proof of thy identity..."
"The Oracle hath always been a fraud! Dost thou not comprehend?"
"Many of the people lack the discipline required to reach their highest potential."
"Here is half of thy reward money. Thou wilt receive the rest when thou dost prove that the killer hath been brought to justice!"
"Take this to Delphynia, the herbalist. Thou mayest find her at the greenhouse."
"A hall of sleeping Daemons..."
"Hast thou ever heard a boy so rude as to talk to his mother that way?"
"Why, we've drifted completely off the subject! What were we talking about...?"
We searched all over the Skullcrusher mountains for this bane.
"Those that live within this abbey believe that Xenka's prophecies hold the key to diverting the fiery end that awaits the world."
"The one called Karnax said that I must fulfill my purpose, or the world itself would be in jeopardy..."
"Fine choice."
"There is nothing worse than deserting thy Command. In times of crisis, thy place is here in Monitor."
"Whom dost thou wish to heal?"
"I recall the last night we ever saw Xenka... I was there for her last three visions. Wouldst thou like me to show thee a vision?"
"Where is it? Thou dost not have the hourglass!"
"She said she was researching the land and seemed anxious to learn all about Serpent Isle. Spektor dealt with her, mostly."
"-What- study?"
"Second Mate Kalen, to ye."
"now shall I return the favor."
"Thou art a vindictive woman to argue with me and then change thy mind out of spite!"
"A few strums from thy strings may bring comfort to this sorrowful town..."
"Surely, thou dost know Spektor the Financier?"
"As thou canst see, this cone still doth have its seeds. It hath been newly released from its tree."
"Oh, I would love to see him. I wonder where he might be."
"It is good that I successfully carried out mine instructions." *"Now, I must rest..."
"Praetimde Mir-Wis Re-Por I."
"Thine ignorance doth make me skittish,~"surely thou hast heard of wise Lord British."
"We are called stone golems... because we are made out of stone and rock."
You see a well-muscled woman who lifts her head in acknowledgement of your presence.
"The Bears say that strength is the key. Well, I can strike before those over-muscled brutes can react!"
"Perhaps thou canst free thy companion -- or unearth the secret of the Oracle!"
"Thou shouldst not waste my time so! I am a busy man!"
"Where is he? 'Twould be good to see him!"
"Erstam the Mad Mage would almost certainly know, but he doth not share his information with anyone."
"I hardly think that thou hast need of me, Avatar. Look at all thy fine companions!"
"Perhaps I could find another song for thee..."
"This is a magnificent building. It serves as both a seat of government where important meetings are held, and as a museum of sorts."
"Dost thou desire another purchase?"
"Thou art a resourceful person. Unfortunately, thy discovery has upset me a great deal."
"Welcome to mine own private shooting gallery, Avatar."
"The earrings, however, are all scattered about in the jewelry box."
"But I have already sold thee the deed to 'The Lusty Wench'! She was the only ship I had at this particular time! I am sorry!"
"I did not know the gargoyle. It sounds as if he was in the wrong place at the wrong time. 'Tis a pity."
"To have told you to seek the Pillar of Fire. To grasp it and enter the Test of the Ancients."
"In fact, I think that I will stay close by thee -- that will be safest for me!"
"Time is short. Move on."
"Alas, he is a poor soul who is doomed to haunt his abode throughout eternity."
"My rates are the same as every other moneychanger..."
"Wouldst thou care for more?"
"Bring the item to me, and I shall discern its origin. Or perhaps I won't. We shall see."
"Thou wilt like the tempo on this one..."
"It must have occurred shortly before I was knocked out."
"He seems to be an unstable man. Sociable at one moment, and deranged in the next!"
"Now that they have it again, we are in dire trouble."
"I already sold thee the deed to 'The Scaly Eel'! It was the only ship I had!"
"Enough! Leave our fair city now."
"Very frightening. Don't care much for Daemons."
"'Tis hard ta find many who have borne more, I'll wager."
"Here thou art."
"Our house band The Avatars is performing in the other room!"
"Stefano would do better practicing his magic... But he would rather be a skilled thief than a novice mage."
"When we sought to question him about thy disappearance, he was nowhere to be found. So we divided to look for thee..."
You see a handsome,hardened, muscular man who, surprisingly, bears a friendly smile on his face.
"Then I need say no more. Surely, Wilfred shall slay the evil sage and reap my revenge."
"Mayhaps another night, then."
"Here is thy room key. It is good only until thou dost leave."
"Dost thou get it? Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! If not, it would be my pleasure to repeat it."
"Ensorcio was Vasculio's apprentice. Too much like his Master, that one."
"Thou wishest to ask more, ask Torrissio... If he will speak with thee."
"I am Polly. It is a pleasure to meet thee."
"Show me thine urn, and I shall unlock its secrets for thee."
"Since thou art a Mage, perhaps thou couldst ask thy fellow wizards about this magical apparatus."
"Thou dost not have enough money, stonehead."
"Thou dost not have enough gold for that!"
"I do not mean this gracious company! Surely thou art among the elite of Britannia and a rare figure of a woman."
"Perhaps another time then..."
You see a gorgeous young woman with seductive eyes.
"I can help thee with that when I am at work."
"Thou shouldst learn to relax."
"One of you wishes to train?"
"Fill it out and return it here at the end of the year when thou dost come back to pay thy taxes."
"Greetings!" says Kliftin. "Hast thou gotten into any scrapes lately?"
"I do believe thou dost not have enough gold coins for a room."
"Then I have a mission for thee."
"Wouldst thou like me to join thee?"
"There is quite a demand for the venom of the silver serpent in certain areas, for instance."
"As a matter of fact, know quite a bit about the people who live here. And I just might even tell thee. What is it worth to thee in gold?"
"It is not safe for thee to have such an item. As the Magister, it is my duty to take that from thee."
"In fact, it sounds as if they could destroy the world!"
"I can give thee 3 guilders for every 1 monetari thou hast."
"Odd brush... Certainly doth not seem like anything a lady would want."
"M-M-Moonglow."
"You are now in possession of the contract."
"Thou dost not have enough gold for that!"
"I have also heard, from a Fawn merchant, that many Fawn citizens would rather face the goblins than the Bears."
"Halt! It is our duty to question thee. Dost thou serve Order or dost thou serve Chaos?"
"As a sign of mine appreciation and great affection for thee, please accept this gift. 'Tis my greatest possession."
"Thou dost not have the money to buy flowers. But take heart, whenever thou canst afford them, I shall still be selling them."
"I knew that thou wert nothing but an imposter."
"Well now, perhaps ye be more wise than ol' Drusilla gave ye credit for. Go back ta the keep. This is no place fer ye."
"One was a priest, another a librarian, and the last was a soldier. I was something once, but I do not recall."
"Most fair, if I do say so myself."
"I will carry that."
"Well, now, there are quite a number of them. And I only know a few... not being a mage."
"Now let the trial resume! Kylista and her knaves shall regret the day they were born..."
"Thou wishest to buy something?"
"I fear we may never find the key to the fountain room now."
"Would that thou wert to believe me, I could tell thee a story! 'Tis done... though not forgotten. I will not talk of it now."
"Thou art truly worthy of thy Knighthood!"
"Thou dost not have enough gold for that!"
"I did not enjoy this waste of my time!"
"Thou wilt understand why I love her, if thou shouldst meet her."
"Thou shouldst simply go to the north end of the field and bring back as many pumpkins as thou can carry!"
"My name is Fred."
"I can give thee 10 monetari for every 1 gold nugget thou hast."
"I was on the Fawn docks chatting with a salt named Olon, in the days before I was banned from the city."
"And, as Leon sows the seeds of The Fellowship, I sow seeds in the soil. Gardening distracts my thoughts from being trapped ashore."
"Then I can do nothing for thee. Unseen evidence is useless evidence."
Thou shalt not use thy tongue to deceive. Remember to practice whatever thou dost advocate.
"And thy name is?"
You see a monk wandering around apparently without direction.
"Everything in this city revolves around the wizards and their cliques. Whom dost thou desire to know about?"
"We try only to please! Tell thy friends about the Sleeping Bull!"
"Xenka was given visions of the ending of our world."
"The trappers live in the Great Northern Forest, at the foot of the Impassable Mountains."
"Bring it with thee some time and I shall tell thee what it is made of."
Today, I encountered a strange white-haired creature from the icy lands; it seemed to be a cross between Man and Beast.
"Maybe thou return later."
"Already I can sense she is worried about our marriage. I know that there is something wrong between us."
"I shall never surrender my sword to my foe."
"To greet you, human," the gargoyle says to Dupre. "To ask how well the study is progressing?"
"I feel much better. The damaged ethereal waves are not striking my mind. But now we must destroy what is causing this problem!"
"Thou couldst talk a beggar out of his begging bowl! I cannot believe I have agreed to such a price!"
"To me, she is the most beautiful woman in Fawn. When thou dost meet her, I'm sure that thou wilt agree with me."
"An engagement ring!"
"I know many songs..." ~"Dost thou wish to hear one I have already sung?" ~"Or dost thou wish to hear a new song?"
"Do not meddle in that which thou dost not understand, hero!" ~"I am the MageLord, and this man is evil."
"I am the mistress of cold-fire magic, a specialty I learned during my many travels to the north."
"Perhaps thou shouldst ask Delin. He is the Provisioner here in town."
You see a jovial man with a wide smile. It is obvious he is enjoying his life.
"Oh, what joy! To be back in Moonshade and free to experiment as I wish!"
"Greetings, visitors! Thanks to the beautiful songs of the bard Iolo, thou hast found favor in our good city."
"I have no love for The Fellowship. We shall speak of it when I know thee better."
"Thou art correct! Longtooth is a great dragon, but he's lousy at riddling!"
He notices your medallion.
"Thou art my savior! I shall await thy return eagerly."
"Room number 3 is available. I am sure thou wilt like it. Here is the key."
"Go away!!"
"I'll wager that ring comes from the Sea City, Fawn. Where else could such a wonderful creation come from?"
"We are the hope of Monitor, the only defense against the Goblins. The Leopards are hopeless, and the Wolves too smart for their own good."
"I am sure that it is magical, if it glows and is cool enough to hold. But I have never heard of it before."
Chantu notices your medallion and his eyes widen.
"There is none to replace her, and certainly none able to reclaim the Helm of Monitor from the Goblins."
Standing at attention just behind him is a wingled gargoyle.
"To know that time is short. To wish that the true Hero shall come soon."
"How many reagents are required to cast the @Mass Death@ spell?"
"It seems that Marsten sought to spare Astrid's life, but he failed her even as he betrayed his Knighthood."
"It's been good to us. It keeps us warm. We are able to find food. I do not miss the old life."
"It mean 'little dew drops' and also mean my name. Neyobi! Me!"
"He knows that the women prefer me to him, and he schemes against me!"
"Dost thou wish to purchase more weapons?"
"Goes ta show what thou knowest!"
"That would be the bloodline of the MageLord of Moonshade, Filbercio."
"We are lost without Astrid, for she was a Warrior of Warriors!"
"She is the Hold advisor, often giving guidance to the knights." His expression becomes wistful. "She is also quite, quite beautiful."
"With the Goblin King slain, perhaps the roads will again be filled. But the storms also discourage travel..."
"We have two prisoners already, but there are many scoundrels who still roam free."
"Thou hast answered well... Of all virtues, Ethicality is often the most subjective and tenuous." *"Thou art worthy to begin the test..."
"Then one day, the young king sailed away, And the old king lost his mind."
"To say that you are confused, but to give you the ring as promised. To say that I am certain that you are the Hero from our dream."
"Thou dost not have enough gold to buy that spell!"
"I am Xenka. Thou must take this Serpent Sword and go to Sunrise Isle."
"Be reverent when thou art in the presence of the Machine of Cremation, as it represents Death itself."
"I cannot accept such an offer!"
"Perhaps I could find another song for thee..."
"To mean `interpreter' in your language."
"He is a druid who began The Fellowship about twenty years ago. He is highly intelligent, and is a warm and gentle human being."
"If thou art ever in need of a healer, I shall be ready to assist thee."
"Perhaps next time."
"Avatar, 'tis the pelts! They can smell we have Gwani pelts on us! I suggest that we throw them away!"
"I have been ready since the moment I first saw thee!"
"To greet thee, On this day,~"'Tis my pleasure, Milady."
"Very good. It pleases me that thou art concerned about my people."
"If thou dost fail in thy quest, our world will end... ripped apart by the earthquakes that will soon plague it."
"He asked me about the bloodthirsty savages that live in the far north -- had a grisly interest in the tale, I might add."
"How many wouldst thou like?"
"I thought thou didst agree to that price!"
"The horse and carriage combination sells for 60 gold. Dost thou want a title?"
"I thank thee for thy kind deed! In return I shall give thee the whistle to summon the Hound of Doskar."
"No one knows what the Leopards stand for anymore! Marsten used to be strong and virile, but now he rules the city from his desk."
"There is no time left! Go to Sunrise Isle!"
"Then I'm leaving!"
"Good. 'Tis always best to have someone to receive flowers. The flowers will cost 10 gold. Dost thou still want them?"
"Fine." The boy looks angry. "But I'll follow thee anyway."
"Perhaps I could find another song for thee..."
"Ye aren't what I expected. But who am I to know what a pawn of prophecy looks like?"
"Then I will continue to keep thine inventory for thee. Find me if thou dost truly want them returned."
After all, it was thee who smashed it into the shards which caused thee so much trouble during the regency of Lord Blackthorn.
"Good. I thought so."
"When thou hast finished thy work, then thy knighting can occur."
"My name is Eiko."
"I myself would not go there. It is said that the heat there is so intense that it is lethal."
The ghostly man displays a face filled with pain.
"Most horrible creatures!"
"I operate the mill here in Paws."
"A decent price."
The gargoyle is obviously displeased with the intrusion of your presence.
"How many great helms wouldst thou care to sell?"
"Congratulations! Thou dost not even need to tell me. I can see that thou hast triumphed in the dungeon."
"Quake at my words, for I am Sesyntho, Scribe to the Hierophant of Chaos! The others say that I am dead, but I am no ghost."
"Milk is good. Milk with honey is preferred by me."
"Thou shouldst ask the armourers of the warrior-city of Monitor -- they make many kinds of armour."
"Unlike my brother, Argus, who came running home to take over the inn."
"This is the manor of the Enchantress Rotoluncia! Thou canst not enter without permission!"
"And, if I might say so, thou art no doubt the most beautiful Knight in the city!"
Danag smiles as if he had just said that you had been invited to dine with the king.
"How else may I help thee?"
"She has left for Britain on important business," he smiles. "I do not expect her return any time soon."
"Thou canst most often find Zulith in the palace, acting as Lady Yelinda's secretary."
"I can see that thou knowest of him."
"The Wolves and the Bears are full of dreams. We Leopards are realistic. We live one day at a time."
"Mine establishment is presently closed. I do not wish to discuss business at this time."
"Wait! Where is it? Thou dost not have it. I hope thou hast not lost it. Thou shouldst go and find it. 'Tis an important document!"
"Thou must feel better to have purged thyself of that burden. Thou wilt now be accepted by all of Monitor."
"See, Avatar? When I press this button, the women become so friendly towards me..."
"She foretold the storms that brought thee to our land, and saw the end of the world."
"I am afraid thou dost not have enough to pay for this..."
"I would give thee thy gold back but I seem to have misplaced it."
"I have heard of the stockings they sell in Moonshade. So I know that such fine work is possible."
"Adepts, be sure to remember this offensive behavior when it comes time to render your verdict."
"Yes, Captain. He came with his accomplice, who was seeking a certain magical leaf..."
"He is a brave and hearty fighter, and," she smiles, "he is also a bit on the attractive side."
"For thy sake, I hope that she doth live, stranger Iolo."
"I am the Educator here, seeker. It is my task to determine how far thine Ethicality hath already progressed before the test may begin."
"Very well. Perhaps I shall journey to Monitor and see what hath transpired there."
"Fruit and milk are Emp foods. Especially fruits are liked by me. Meats," he shakes his head,~~"are -not- liked by Emps."
"How might I aid the Champion of Balance in fulfilling thy duty?"
"Oh, I had feared that I would never see thee again!"
A strong, powerful man looks at you and nods acknowledgment.
"'Tis a sad affair. One of our patrols was ambushed, and the Goblins slew nearly all of them! Only Templar survived to return."
"I am the stables caretaker."
"I could make thee a good offer... Say, 120 guilders. Wilt thou sell it?"
"Although the MageLord's power is great, it is held in check by the other members of the Council of Mages."
"No warrior could ever feel comfortable in such a setting. They care nothing for Duty and Courage -- only pleasure!"
"Liar! Thou didst enjoy thy role as Priestess, using thy sensual powers over men."
"I have taught here for many years. I like the town, but I am not too fond of some of the residents."
"'Tis the largest building in the city, except for my palace."
Horffe is standing at attention just behind him.
"Hmmm, a key. Perhaps if thou dost ask Christopher's son about it, he may know what it is for."
"There is so much that thou canst teach us."
"Thou dost not have enough money to buy it!"
"One must have his pride, or be merely a worm..."
"Surely thou canst do better than that! If thou simply dost not wish to answer my question why dost thou not say so?"
"I have been searching all over for thee! That storm hath left me quite disconcerted. I can find neither Iolo nor Dupre."
"But I've never seen lightning that changes a man into a rock, or makes a ship disappear before thy very eyes."
"No, no, I do not speak with strangers... I only care to speak with my fellow Knights."
"Ahh, thou art in fine company then, felon. Only yesterday we had another such felon arrive... Let us see. Stefano was his name."
"Another time, then."
Jeweled coins from the City of Beauty, Fawn.
"If I cannot remain here, we shall meet at the Blue Boar Inn in Moonshade."
"If thou wishest Fawn ale, it only comes in brown bottles."
"Through these ancient items, a Power shall communicate with thee. More than this, I know not."
"Askin' about folk tales. Bought the boys a round or two ta loosen their tongues. Her favorites were the tales of the Gwani."
"It matters not if one has no Enthusiasm for one's orders. Those in command know what must be done, that is enough for a true warrior."
"Seek the answer to this mystery, or thou shalt not succeed! Now, I must go..."
"Thou cannot possibly carry that much!"
"I got another one!" he says gleefully. "Thou must speak with my father right away!"
"What wouldst thou like to buy?"
"I am satisfied with thy report. Please carry on thine investigation, Avatar."
"I regret that thou dost not seem to have enough gold to train here. Mayhaps at another time, when thy fortunes are more prosperous."
"Luther is the worst!"
"From thy description, the stockings could only be one kind -- Moonsilk Stockings."
"Good. One less thing I have to carry."
"I shall be happy to serve thee during business hours!"
"But those in the keep refuse to acknowledge that there are others that follow other paths. Fools!"
"To be displeased that you do not have the Goblet. To be unwilling to deal with you until you have gotten it."
"Failure in BrendanUsable(_Pathfind2) because we couldn't find the door."
"Shamino the Anarch is the current MageLord. He hath brought great change to our city..."
"Come to the dining room during breakfast or dinner and I will be most honored to serve thee!"
"To be the clerk of The Fellowship here."
"Others will tell thee that my mother died in a battle with road bandits, but I know better. She had lost the will to live!"
"Who thou want to heal?"
"Why should I tell thee what I have learned? Thou mayest well be the murderer..."
"Leon seeks to divert unsuspecting people from Beauty's path. He is the one that hath brought the anger of the heavens down upon us!"
"Excellent! I have no doubts now that thou art the one true Avatar!"
"I strongly suspect that the source of thine infection is the tattoo thou hast been given."
"Take thy gem!"
"Then please browse if thou dost like."
"Thou art not the first to seek this secret from me, adventurer! That fat fool Batlin purchased it from me, too."
"Could it be Mortegro, he for whom the cold sensations of death are more vivid than life?"
"Within the great wide forest, Hard on the snow and ice, There dwells a man called the Forest Master Who rules both plant and beast."
"Here is the room key. It is good only until thou dost leave the inn."
"I would know that it was cold, dear Rocco, but it would not trouble me."
"Is it any wonder that they could not stand to live within the rule of an honest man?!"
"I am the Sultan of Spektran! What, is thy brain the size of a pea? Do not answer, 'twas a rhetorical question."
"The Serpent people dwelt in this land long before our forefathers settled here. I do not know what happened to them, but Karnax might."
"There are many beautiful plants in this area. I am working on learning about all of them."
"If thou desirest more, simply inquire at the Winery on the west side of town."
"Yes, it is not far from the castle, to the southwest. It is just south of the theatre."
"I must wait another hour."
"Thou art the woman of my dreams! I have never felt so refreshed. What an experience..."
"Oh. Well, carry on with thine investigation."
"Thou dost stand there without clothes, and claim to be innocent? Ha!"
"As I have said, I serve and protect my master's household. This have I done for a great many years."
"I would rather belong to the Bear Command than accept such an offer!"
"I run the Fellowship shelter with my wife Brita and my son Garritt here in Paws."
"I do not see our old friends Iolo, Shamino, or Dupre much."
"Now I see thee. Greetings! I am Boydon, the Living Head."
"Yes, dost thou not recognize me?" She pauses, glaring at you. "But who art thou, and where are my pastries?"
"I am one of the elite... The ultimate Order warrior. I have traded my body for eternal service to Order."
"He did strike me as a kindly man, of affable temperament. Good with children. Not the kind to consort with Daemons."
"Am still Gilwoyai."
"Please leave if thou canst not pay."
"Do not listen to her accusations about the Sorceress Columna -- all imaginings, not true!"
"I do not know what thou must do... I only know that thou must possess the Serpent Necklace before thou hast hope of succeeding."
"Deliver the wand to me, and thou shalt have thy desires!"
"Very good! Now, if I may see it, I may be able to unlock the secret to restoring thy lady friend."
"What reagent wouldst thou like to buy?"
"Go inside. Tell them you are the Avatar!"
"Many thanks for returning this, Avatar."
"Everyone says that he might be alive, but it hath been weeks since he disappeared. I am old enough to face the truth."
"Perhaps thou art not as fond of the sea as I..."
"'Tis fine, I do not need another one."
"I am De Maria, the Bard."
"Within the Hourglass of Fate lie the Sands of Time. As each grain doth fall, so doth another moment hasten us to our doom."
"Lady Yelinda will surely wish to thank thee herself."
"I would give thee thy deed but thou art carrying too much."
"Indeed, the sage Batlin was also curious about the ruins."
"Well, I would sign it, but it seems thou hast lost it. If thou dost find it again I will be more than happy to help thee and the Emps."
"I have no choice but to accept it at thy price. Assuredly, I have no other offers."
"Then I shall add to it."
"Delin, take thy daughter in hand! She speaks out of turn."
"Thy friends must learn not to interfere in the interests of mages. Let them learn now!!!"
"If thou wouldst bring the object to my shop, I would be glad to examine it there. I do not have my tools with me now."
"At the nearest tavern, of course!"
Day 31: Very stormy weather and worse at night.
"Allow me to handle it..."
"He is the guard at the south gate of Monitor. He hath a keen eye, despite his getting along in years."
"Oh -- didst thou forget? How embarrassing..."
"Oh... why, yes... of course. Make it so."
"Help me, Please! I beseech thee..." *"I cannot survive much more of this..." *"Uunnggghhh!"
"Come back and work for me at any time!"
They must be led by that villainous Shamino.
"If thou hast spoken to each of us and hast determined that one of us is guilty, accuse accordingly. But be not hasty in thy judgment."
"Our city is ruled by the MageLord Filbercio. He is benevolent and wise, and rules well."
"Oh. Well, perhaps thou canst become enlightened another time."
"I do not know thou art a friend... I shall let thee in, but thou must have an escort until thou hast spoken to Lord Marsten."
"Elissia... Dear, sweet Elissia..."
"Thou shouldst not waste my time so! I am a busy man!"
"Dost thou know nothing?! Why, we Monitorians have rebuilt the ancient highways, and added new trails and byways."
"Jendon! Bring thy lazy backside over here! Thou hast a payin' customer with a thirst."
"Thou art wonderful! I will think of thee every time I wear them!"
"I am the owner and proprietor of the dairy here in Paws."
"The only problem is that none have ever won free. And Filbercio reigns unchallenged."
"I am Leon, a speaker for The Fellowship and former farmer."
"Pomdirgun is far more cunning than normal goblins. He hath attacked Fawn without respite for nearly a year now."
"But we can discuss this upon thy return... if thou dost have the courage to take the Test of Knighthood..."
"If I had not seen his face the day he boarded, I would have thought him a Daemon. He was so green."
"Frankly, I do not care to know much about that place."
"'Tis strange! I thought for certain that thou wert the theatrical type!"
"Nothing is more cruel than unflinching Honesty. It doth shatter hearts, instill insecurity, and promote civil strife."
"Xenka is our exemplar -- we all would harness the Powers as she did."
"They say that I shall feel better soon..."
"I am sorry, I must wait a while before I can heal again."
"FATHER!!!"
"I shall add to it."
"Yesterday, thou wouldst not have found me in such a generous mood as this. I should starve, if I sold goods at this price every day!"
"What is thy need?"
"Wouldst thou like something else?"
"Dost thou see? When taken with the other signs, it points to thee as the one who alone can save our land."
"What dost thou want? I have already enchanted the ring!"
"That's all right, honey."
"Thou canst bargain Rocco down on his prices, if thou dost try hard enough."
"It is quite a material, is it not? I imagine it could be used for many magical things."
"Wouldst thou like to order a meal?"
"It is one foretold by Gwenno!"
"Thou didst never take care of thyself when I was away..."
"If that is what thou dost truly want, I will leave. But if thou dost ever change thy mind, do ask me to join again and I will."
"Stoneheart is the ore that produces Bloodspawn. I know not how this is done. I am not a Mage."
"How ingenious! Please! Deliver it to Syria as soon as thou art able! And I thank thee for thy trouble in helping me!"
"Wilt thou pay my price... for passage to Skara Brae?"
"To be caught in indecision!"
"My store is now closed. I am usually open in the afternoons."
"I am a sell-sword. But at the moment, I am trying to help my friend regain his senses."
"Now, thou didst ask about Alyssand's ring... I would call her and ask her to show it to thee, but Alyssand lost her ring not long ago."
You see a man who exudes the outward mannerisms of a shrewd administrator, in contrast to his youthful appearance.
"We long for word of how the War of Imbalance turns."
"Thou dost know that Filbercio is lower than swine..." ~"He doth deserve to be tortured for all the ill that he hath done."
"This place is the Temple of Emotion. It is a structure consecrated to the Virtue of Emotion."
"Excellent! I have no doubt now that thou art the one true Avatar!"
"Manipulation of time and space requires more power than one monk can channel."
"The Lady hath admitted them back into the city, thou dost know... They have not made trouble yet, but I'm keeping an eye on them."
"To head The Fellowship in Terfin."
"Reconsider, Avatar! Thou couldst spend the rest of thy life waiting for another chance to return to thine home and family..."
"Thine hands are too full to take the Orb!"
Raymundo hands you a staff.
"With such a bright wit, I think it would be fitting indeed!"
"Silverpate is the great-grandfather of Angus."
"Thou hast mistaken me for a common gossip."
"To need one last task from you. To be without doubt. To be done before giving thee the artifact."
"To have a great treasure among the Gargoyles, an artifact discovered among the ruins. To not know its powers."
"We shall see..."
"Merrick joined The Fellowship so he could live in their shelter, the poor sod."
"Why is it that a woman must have a man? I have looked and looked, and I have not yet found the one for me."
"Hmmm. I do not like big crowds. I shall wait until thy group is smaller before joining."
"Arrogant manipulators! Never once did they attempt to divine if my visions were true!"
"My name is Lucilla. Is there anything I can do for thee? Anything at all?"
"One must make a living, must one not? I will accept this price."
"More like someone to cook Luther's meals! Har!"
"Thou hast completed the experiment. As a token of appreciation, here is the Mirror of Truth."
"Of course thou mayest have free reign of the building. But first," he grins, "let me show thee my..."
"Why, she sleeps with her rats! I ask thee, is this the action of a respectable mage?"
"Besides, what hast thou done to warrant thy worries that I might be following thee?"
"Watch thy step, lest thou be exiled like the Fellowship folks. Without thee to help us, our Cause would be lost."
"What? Dost thou not trust my word?"
"Wait, Hero -- I can only speak with thee this once! Dost thou understand all that I have said?"
"I am not worthy of my Number 3! Where is Number 7, the keeper of the key?!"
"A woman of Courage! I perceive that thou hast the spirit of a warrior."
The music starts the play, as Paul takes center stage and addresses the audience.
"I want that back! It belongs to me!"
"Perhaps some other time..."
"Let me give this to thee, as a token of my great esteem for thine ability to save my life."
"I make weapons and armour."
"If thou art ready to see thy friend again, ask and I will return them to thee."
"I do not recall seeing thy face among the Fawn Tower garrison. Have I met thee? I regret I cannot remember..."
"Thou cannot possibly carry that much!"
"Be wary, for there is a thief in this town! Some silver serpent venom was stolen from Morfin."
"I do not know of a 'Guardian'. Art thou sure he really exists? Thou shouldst investigate further."
"I'll give thee three clues:"
"Thou wouldst have me say such things in front of a stranger? 'Tisn't polite ta speak of a lady in such a fashion, Jendon."
"She is the Priestess of Beauty. Thou canst find her at the temple."
"If I can help thee with food or drink, please say so. I have never had a dissatisfied customer."
"Is there anything else I can help thee with?"
"I believe her name is Camille."
"Perhaps some other time, then."
"To be Gargoyle for `make healed one.'"
"I always knew that thou wert a coward!"
"I thank thee. Thou hast shown thyself to be a true patron of the arts and a person of culture and refinement."
"I find it hard to believe that any member of my Command could be a traitor to Monitor."
"If thou art going to restore Balance thou wilt have to act quickly."
"The Mages of Moonshade are quite powerful, and have found the way to acquire servants such as myself."
"Life as a spectral being is so tedious. Once, I was a woman in the prime of my life. Now I merely exist..."
"Oh, I thank thee, Avatar! My fate and the fates of my wife and daughter are in thine hands!"
"I'm sorry, but that is not the correct answer."
"If thou changest thy mind, thou hast but to return and ask."
"But since those cursed storms destroyed the fleet, there hath been precious little business."
"Thou dost want to join me in the Community Room?"
"Great Captain Joth is in charge of finding the means to sustain the city until this unusual weather clears."
"It was she who foresaw thy coming in the Place of Visions. Though she never told us that she foresaw leaving us..."
"In which circle of magic art thou interested?"
"Flindo was the one that bribed the Pikemen into pulling me away from the fight he started!"
"Rocco is the proprietor of the Blue Boar Inn. Most of the people in the city -- Mage and Mundane alike -- eat there."
Milky eyes glitter up at you like twin marbles, "Ah, yes. But thou knowest all too well about that little bauble.
"But thou dost not have a bill of law!"
"Kylista and Voldin have defiled these proceedings! False evidence hath been offered! This trial is a farce!"
"I am ashamed that he is a Leopard! I hope that he doth rot in jail for a very long time!"
"Oh, dost thou want the password now?"
"That cold fish Spektor must have coaxed thee to this. He hath been jealous of my manliness for many moons..."
"A malformed flying horror. Thou wouldst not want to meet one."
The path to fulfillment is a long climb towards the heights of the highest and greatest mountain of all.
"My vife is a vise voman who has some ov the necessary talents to see the future. Thou shouldst speak vith her."
"Do not ask me! Silverpate was a pirate... Who knows what such a man would have hidden?"
"Thou knowest where my daughter doth go at noon?"
"Fawn's guard captain is a fellow named Jorvin."
"Foul blasphemy! Hold thy tongue, rogue, or face the wrath of the Oracle."
"Oh, I do not want to speak about mine home. Mine husband and I... well, we are not altogether... happy."
"Then thou wilt have to move on..."
"I serve on the Great Council. Today we are working on a bill of law. When I am not here in the castle, I am kept busy with a young child."
"And if thou dost ever have something that I could use, please bring it. Nothing large. Perhaps a morsel of food."
"Thou shouldst know better than to meddle in the affairs of Fate, Thoxa. By merely talking with the Hero, thou mayest be condemning us."
"Most fair, if I do say so myself."
"Thou wilt have to discover the way back by thyself. Thou canst not expect me to tell thee everything!"
"Of the two-score settlers who came to this place led by Draygan, only three of us survive! And the other two work for him!"
"Perhaps if thou wouldst ask one of the monks -- perhaps Thoxa -- she could try to divine where the Chaos Hierophant lies."
"To be the one named Quan."
He raises his shoulders, making him appear quite sheepish.
"Minoc was usually busy, but quiet. Then our town was bothered by this nonsense over Owen's monument, and now these murders."
"My fee will leave thee with nothing!"
"Thou hast slain the lurker of these depths, but others await thee! Thou shalt not prevail, stranger."
"Thou dost see them across the land, left behind by the evil creatures which once dwelled in this place."
"Oh, please."
"Not so fast, mealworm! I have developed an appetite for thee!"
"Alyssand, we are told that thou hast often been seen in the company of the accused traitor. What things hath he asked of thee?"
"I only felt the power move, as a swimmer feels the currents within a stream."
"An' him worried about what's proper an' what's not..."
"Ah, thou hast spoken with Delphynia already! Dost thou have the Varo leaves?"
"Thou shalt have to ask Ophelia about that. My domain is the kitchen!"
"Return when thou hast the Three Artifacts of the Great Hierophant: Staff, Armour, and Crown."
This is a bright woman who looks much younger than she actually is.
"All I know is that these Ophidians starting slaughtering each other about one year ago."
"Do not let him say such things about thee, Avatar!"
"I can tell thee who a piece belongs to just by looking at it. I remember everything I've made."
He stops mid-spell and begins another, pointing towards the Talisman of Infinity.
"The Emerald serves only the best wine and ale. I cannot recommend the water, however. Thanks to Lock Lake."
"Garth is also something of a ladies' man, I fear."
"Doth he not ever smile? He doth have the look of a convict, that's what I say."
"We had just finished the tournament and were on our way to the list field door."
"Please, I beg of thee to reconsider."
"I see." *"Very well, I will agree to this price even though 'tis lower than I did wish."
"Thou hast filled my world with the love I never knew while my body lived. For that, I have called thee here for one last sight of thee..."
"Failure in BrendanUsable(_Pathfind1) because we couldn't find the guard of the list fields."
"We revere and protect all beautiful things here in Fawn. Everyone is dedicated to the truths of Beauty."
"What wouldst thou like to buy?"
"Let me say this plainly. Mosh lies. She hath ruined herself with cruel indulgences, and now she is half mad."
"Be thou careful with that blade."
"To have listened to the dying speech of one explorer, and have heard of a Magic Goblet which lies in this room."
Now the blade needs to have its sorcerous energies realigned if it is to ever contain another bound spirit.
"Twist and turn and twine about... What was wrong is right, and what was in, is out..."
"Excellent, my friend."
"Cheese and milk are liked by Emps, but they are hard to find. Only from humans can these foods be found."
"Very well. Here then, take this copy. And do not lose this one!"
"Very good," he says, notably relieved. "I thank thee in advance."
"Who doth know? Perhaps one day thou couldst become a true knight of Monitor. But only if thou passest the Test of Knighthood."
"Well... I was going to return the money eventually. I just needed it to win more in the games."
"I do not wish to spend my limited vitality in idle chatter. I am a warrior, not a clerk..."
"With soft grey fur, they walk about On two legs just like men."
"Thou dost not have enough gold, eh? That be right bad."
"Then he can remain in jail until he rots. I have no love of mages. I will not abide their pranks under any circumstances."
"Come to the building just south of the entrance to Knight's Test. There I can properly attend to thee before the test."
"..and I am linked by fate to Columna, the Green Enchantress! She is my very own sister."
"Perhaps thou didst not walk fast enough. If thou dost lag, the explosions will catch thee."
"Tsk tsk... I am broken-hearted..."
"I have not spoken to the Time Lord in months! How is the old codger? Give him my regards. Tell him I miss our Knight's Bridge games!"
"I am cheered that thou dost like it..."
"There hath been trouble of late here in Fawn..."
"If ye say so. I know that blasted Britannian Tax Council or what have ye has made the cost o' things too high! Maybe next time!"
"Hurry, Avatar, I am waiting for thee..."
"And it is so seldom that we are able to talk! Be sure to give my greetings to Lord Marsten."
"And when thy load is lighter, then I can give thee thy beverages."
"Then Simon dead. Was good spy. Didst thou eat him?"
"Voldin is the one who truly controls the Great Captains. I think he would make himself ruler of Fawn, if he could find a way."
"Thou cannot possibly carry that much!"
You see a striking woman in fighter's gear. She looks at you fiercely.
"Perhaps it was not the wisest of things to have done... As I am trapped here and have no idea how to return to Moonshade."
"Ah, I knew thou wert a good 'un."
"What dost thou want for thy refreshment?"
"Someday I hope to be as rich and lazy as my master!"
"But Brion is more interesting to me."
"Then again, thou didst restore the wand to me -- and the Philanderer's Friend is a great prize..."
"Be ye wantin' food or drink?"
"Look at any Pikeman thou dost meet. Thou wilt most likely see another shield precisely like the one thou hast described."
"Except for the three strangers, the only relatively new person on the island is Alagner, the sage."
"He was on patrol near Monitor. He told the pikemen that he had found something suspicious, and he went to look... and he never returned."
"Since thou dost not have the guilders to pay me, I am afraid thou wilt have to suffer, felon."
"Thou cannot possibly carry that much!"
"That shield could belong to anyone in this town. Green and white are the colors of Monitor and its warriors."
"I am able to heal, cure poison, and resurrect. Art thou interested in one of these services?"
"I do not know what that is, but it doth give me a shuddery feeling. Please, take it away..."
"Use thine hands to search as well as thine eyes, for some things are invisible."
"I am no boy, mother. For now, I'm the innkeeper here and I'll thank thee to remember that we have a mage staying here now."
"Like all the other Bears, I think he prefers to hunt other warriors! He always bullies the strangers that come into town."
"To call the creature, go to the docks. There, thou shalt find a ship's bell."
Having no idea what the password actually is, you take a wild guess, saying something that sounds like it might make a proper password.
"Wouldst thou like to know more about the men of Monitor?"
"I serve Britain's finest ale and wine."
You see a winged gargoyle with an authoritative disposition.
"'Tis thine!"
"I am a gatherer of food."
"'Twill cost thee 2 gold each. Still interested?"
"'Tis a bottle of Fawnish ale."
"Hello, Avatar."
"The Avatar! Forgive me... unlike these local folk, I know whom thou art!"
"Prepare thyselves..."
"But I do not care. Hast thou noticed how beautiful the sunsets have been lately?"
"Not so fast! Thou shouldst know that I met with thine ally, the fat and loathsome sage called Batlin..."
"Thy friends will have to help carry these things."
"Thou shalt need three ancient and powerful artifacts to complete thy tasks. One of these is a helm. It seems very familiar to me..."
"I'm sorry... Thou hast heard all of my songs."
"Go quickly! The end is at hand!"
"Sometimes he even sends Gwani pelts! He likes hunting Gwani because it is such a challenge."
"Thou mayest be laughing but surely thy purse is not, for it is empty."
"A grayish rock? Light in weight for its mass?"
"Perhaps I could find another song for thee..."
"Knowest thou the brave Pikemen that restored our safety? I am sure that Lady Yelinda would like to thank them personally, if possible."
"To know he will not believe one who openly defies The Fellowship."
"Thou wouldst not recognize a love story if it hit thee between the eyes, Jendon."
You are surprised to see your old companion Jaana, looking only slightly aged since your last visit.
"As thou canst see, I have had much practice on myself. As the tattooist, I can have as many tattoos as I desire..."
"I believe his name is Tobias."
"I shall answer thy questions truthfully, Avatar. Of what can I tell thee?"
"Aimi also paints. Or rather, makes a bold attempt. I must, of course, commend her for her efforts."
"For naught more than 5 gold thou canst get a lovely room. Dost thou wish to stay the night?"
"Why, that magical creation doth have a budding romance with the shopgirl from the Canton!"
"Oh, well, I cannot remember."
"Good Mages, this is the adventurer from a distant land whose arrival was foretold in our conjurings!"
"Thou hast not the gold for that!"
"Monitor is on the southern edge of the mainland. Its citizens are noted for their bravery."
"A human. How interesting. What dost thou want?"
"The Wolves pride themselves on cunning. Fools! They cannot think past my blinding sword strikes."
"Wouldst thou care to buy weapons or armour?"
"As thou dost well know, seeing that I did obtain thee an audience with the MageLord. Who else could have done such a thing?"
"He favors beginning to rebuild the fleet now, but hath deferred to Voldin's opinion that it would not be safe to do so at this time."
"Free them at once!"
"I remember that we spoke of the strange storms, and other such things..."
You see a friendly woman in her thirties.
"There may be hope after all... Here is the scroll."
"Silence, chit! What dost thou know of these matters?"
"To want something else?"
"Such items of heavy armour are not needed here, as we depend upon the Mages for our defense."
You tell Penumbra the story of how you need to get the hourglass enchanted.
"I apologize for being brusque with thee before. I had no true concept of thine abilities."
"'Tis always a pleasure to see thee, Avatar. How may I be of service to thee?"
"That despicable interloper Mortegro interfered with mine experiments, and betrayed me to the Council of Mages!"
"'Tis a long story. I shall probably be dead before I can finish it."
"I am undone! Mine heart grieves. I must go away to be with my thoughts..."
"Thou hast the Armour of Beauty! Oh, what a sign from the heavens!"
"Sure. They know Mama and me. We are their friends."
"The other Knights might grovel after money, but not I! I am no Spektor!"
"My supply comes from some old friends in Buccaneer's Den. Where they get it, who can say?"
"Well, I am really not at liberty to divulge the names of our patrons. But most of them belong to The Fellowship."
"And do not think of killing me and taking the Serpent. I have it well hidden."
"Thou dost not have enough gold for my fine apparel. Perhaps in the near future."
"Dost thou want for anything else?"
Nevertheless, you persevere and retrieve the lovely little gem.
"Much better."
I then tried C.B.W. and O.-- again, none of the runes were in the correct position.
"I hate to speak ill of anyone, but for Zulith I shall make an exception."
"Put that away! I hope that no one saw..."
"His name was, ah... Seth, I believe. Good healer, but he had a nasty temper." *"I am certain that the Goblins found him a bitter meal. Ha!"
"Perhaps this means that there is more yet to be discovered. I shall certainly continue my search."
"Done! Eat hearty!"
"All right."
"Dost thou wish something else?"
"He was another one who was dead from the neck up!"
"Do that, and quiet! Thou hast interrupted all my tales so far. 'Tis rude."
"Perhaps those hermits are still living in the cave."
"Yes, I did meet the scholar when she was here. A fine lady, of good temperament."
"Unless thou canst show me thy Medallion of Order, I shall have to slay thee. Dost thou have one?"
"To say they are brawny warriors in stout armour. To delight in shedding our blood. To hate us greatly."
"Thou hast not the room for this meat."
"In what way can I help thee, stranger?"
"The experiments are, to say the least, quite messy..."
"In thine honor, all of the Commands of Monitor have sent their representatives to thy Knighthood Banquet."
"What? I thought we had an agreement."
"I will make thee a Worm Gem if thou wilt come to my shop when I am there..."
"Perhaps we could become friends."
"Thou cannot carry that much!"
"Please return when we are open!"
"She was long dead..."
"And what a temper! 'Tis to be hoped he is better mannered on land."
"I am Zelda."
"Kylista presides over the Oracle, which never varies in supporting her views..."
"Jorvin be the Commander of the Fawn Guards. He is a fine, strong lad. And I think that he is sweet on the Lady."
"I know little about the wilderness areas hereabouts. I be a town man, meself."
"What? Art thou daft?" He shakes his head. "Well, at least thou art in the right area for gardening."
"Afraid of a bit of rain?"
"Why, I sold that cap myself, from this very shop!"
"An' that be a large job for such slender shoulders, make no mistake!"
"She is quite helpful to me. I think I shall make her my chief advisor..."
"I can give thee 3 guilders for every 2 gold coins thou hast."
"I tire of this entire system. Wolves! Bears! Leopards! Why can we not be united, rather than divided into Commands?"
"It appears that thou art already as proficient as I! I am afraid that thou cannot be trained further here."
"To be not well? To be terrible! To think there is anything to do to help?"
"How could thee renounce thy rightful liege?"
"The fortune vill cost thee 20 gold. All right?"
"Simon was a Goblin spy! I would never have suspected..."
"'Twas Stefano who stole my stockings from Torrissio's house in an attempt to blackmail us over our affair."
If thou hast need of them, I will provide them.
"Father was a member of The Fellowship. I don't know why the medallion was in the chest -- he usually wore it."
The Cube vibrates.
"Then I must go this one myself," he says angrily. "'Tis no more than one friend would do for another... no more than Bollux did for me!"
"As I think the key might be useful to thee, I am giving it to thee."
"But sometimes 'tis FLASH!, and something thou wert watching is a big, orange pumpkin."
"This be Delphynia's favorite tale."
"I am the Knight in charge of the Test of the Knights."
"My price is 45 gold for each training session, but I will also teach thee what little I know about magic. Is this acceptable?"
"I sense that it doth have unusual powers... incredible energies... hidden abilities..."
"As thou art not!"
"Wilt thou come with me now? I am sure that thou canst return home at last."
"I cannot believe that thou hast out-bargained me so..."
"I am Torrisso of Moonshade, Adept Mage and master of life spells."
"Here is the imitation I have made of the Library of Scars' honor flag."
"Oooh, 'tis a large one."
"Why, right now 'tis adventuring with that most courageous of all legendary heroes, the Avatar!"
"Wouldst thou care to purchase something else?"
"If I cannot succeed in the bedroom, I might as well try in the kitchen! Homely women make good cooks, they say..."
"My name is Sprellic."
"Please come to my place of business during normal daylight hours."
"Thou must not forget our distant liege, Lady Yelinda. All hail Lord British and the glory that is Britannia!"
"Isn't it obvious? The bard is a light-minded man, disrespectful of proper authority! Iolo is not a man to be trusted."
"I found out how very lonely certain of these folks have been -- particularly the women..."
"Astrid was a magnificent Knight Champion! Even though she was a Bear and I a Leopard, we were boon companions."
"I agree, thou ought to consider it."
"Quickly, put the egg into the machine!"
"I have taught many a warrior how to use his -- or her -- force against an opponent."
"Thank goodness, thou wert able to restore him to life. Else I would never finish my Mage's training!"
"To be agreed!"
"I have not had a supply wagon bring arms or furs in a score of days. 'Tis the storms!"
"There are many who live within the walls of the Hold. Sir Denton, the bartender at the Hallowed Dock, knows them all."
"But I don't understand. How didst thou survive the Knight's Test? We fixed the place with traps to be absolutely fatal!"
"I know not what the powers of the Teeth might be, but they might reveal their secret to thee."
"Well, I am sure thou wilt have time soon enough, for he will surely head this way to attack me again."
Dear reader, make of mine experiments what thou wilt.
"Yes, master..."
"I fear that the storms have driven my prices up. I have no choice unless I wish to starve."
"Then if thou hast discovered the true force that killed my father, my vengeance against Kalideth would be unjust."
"That is where all the novice mages are taught. Look for the youngsters in the street and thou wilt find it."
"Return to Monk Isle, and return with fresh roots of the Mandrake!"
"The current members are Mortegro, Gustacio, and Filbercio... of course."
"Yes, Master. How may I serve thee..." The wavering visage in the mirror hesitates for a moment, "Thou art not my master."
"I noticed I had lost the locket right after I spoke with those three strangers yesterday. Wouldst thou help me find it?"
"The business hours are from 9am to 6pm. Return then."
"I am Rayburt."
"To want to purchase how many?"
"If thou hast spoken to each of us and hast determined that one of us is guilty, accuse accordingly. But be not hasty in thy judgment."
"My name is Kessler."
"My name is Columna. Sorceress, wife of Melino, and I am also the most desired beauty in Moonshade."
"There are many, many others like Sasha who have been led astray. For them, I see no future."
"I grieve that I cannot tell thee how this is done... Such knowledge was for the Chaos Hierophant only."
"To notice you are obviously not interested."
"Even with all his magic, Torrissio cannot construct new automatons --"
"Oops. Thine hands are too full to take it. Ask me about it later."
"But I have felt great tides of power being directed toward it."
"If thou shouldst bring a return message, I will introduce thee to my shipmate, Scots, who makes maps."
"Perhaps crafted from the thigh bone of one of mine old friends. Someday, thou or I too may be odd bits of furnishings in some Goblin hut!"
"What potion dost thou wish to purchase?"
"I direct thee to go immediately to MageLord Filbercio with this matter."
"Jeanette, at thy service!"
"Remember to bear each of the symbols of power upon thy person, or thou shalt not enter the most sacred precincts therein."
"Ah, thou hast spoken with our Commander! Very good. What can I do for thee?"
"I am Penumbra. Surely thou dost remember me?"
"The intruder is thine enemy, and is not one with us. He doth not comprehend Chaos. If thou wilt listen to the others, they can aid thee."
"I train my students to be fierce and ruthless fighters!"
"Thou wouldst have me say such things of a lady? Weren't thou the one what was tellin' me ta mind me manners?"
"On a guess, I'd say it came from Monitor. Everyone knows that they practically sleep with weapons such as this."
The ape-like creature slowly and cautiously walks up to you. He, or she, sniffs for a moment, and then points to the honey you are carrying.
"With my dying breath, I place the Curse of the Red Witch upon thee!"
"Let us meet at the abbey on Monk Isle, should I be forced to wander from this spot. No doubt Thoxa can fetch me there."
"I predict this: I see thee lying dead at the feet of one who prowls this labyrinth."
"Perhaps another time, then..."
"Which of my services dost thou have need of?"
"Could I see thy bottle? Hmm... A bitter ale of some kind."
"Sasha vill have to decide if he vants to stay vith his people or return to The Fellowship. I believe he vill make the right choice."
"Thou still hast much to teach us."
"Thou dost not seem to have as much gold as I require to train here. Mayhaps at another time, when thy fortunes are more prosperous..."
"So, thou hast heard of my new shield! No one hath ever seen the like of it before. It is so light, yet blows seem to bounce off of it..."
"The Test takes place here, beyond that locked door."
"So, Simon was a Goblin in disguise! 'Twas a clever bit of deduction on thy part to uncover his secret."
Martingo then pulls out a banana and begins to peel it.
"I am the leader of the Command of the Bear. The Bears are the bravest, most virile warriors in Monitor! Courage is our name."
"Thy speech does me service. Alas! Too few are the women who learn skill in arms."
"Remember, these wares shall be here when thou dost return!"
"I can give thee 1 monetari for every 3 guilders thou hast."
"I seem to recall that there was a secret entrance to the west..."
"The ethereal ring must be enchanted."
"Very well. Dost thou know the answers to the questions of Life and Death?"
"The charges against Krayg are odious. Simply because a man is different, doth not make him a criminal! He is not the traitor."
"These are fine things, not what thou wouldst find among the women of fisher-folk."
"Rocco would have me scrapped for lowering my prices like this. Please do not tell him..."
Leavell balances his dagger on his fingertip. In a blur of motion, he snatches it out of the air, pointing at you. He stares you in the eye.
You point out to Jeanette that Charles is a servant.
"All things good possess an innate Beauty that attracts all living things."
"This bottle must be his! Luther is the traitor!"
"I have sent for a judge from the High Court in Yew. I realize thou dost not have the time for such petty matters."
"What dost thou care to sell, friend?"
"This leads to a passageway which will bring thee to the chief's village, hidden in a secret valley. No Man hath ever set foot there..."
"There is a song about the lady." ~"Wouldst thou care to hear it?"
"Good idea, Petra!"
"Good day, uh... Voldin. Met who?"
You see a stealthy-looking woman, dressed all in green. There is a wicked grin on her face.
"The ring! I am a prisoner of my former self, for without the ring I cannot right the world!"
"Thou must bring me three Worm Hearts -- no less!"
"Who dost thou wish ta know about -- townsfolk or strangers?"
"I am Paul. My colleagues' names are Meryl and Dustin."
"Thou canst not know what humiliation is until thou hast been turned out from thine home and told never to return on pain of death!"
"I would have words with thee but my duties call."
"I bear three gifts from thine admirer -- a magic scroll, an earring, and a note."
"Thou dost not have enough experience. Come back when thou art more knowledgeable of the world!"
"Pinecones come from the northern woods." ~"Purty things, ain't they? I collect 'em and give 'em to sweet gals like Bucia at the Canton."
Remember all weapons ought to be kept ready for immediate use.
"The ice wine is special indeed! I will not tell thee the secret of how it is made, but be assured that it is most flavorful!"
"These are imported from Fawn, where the womenfolk are skilled at making strong cloth."
"I sell everything that thou wouldst need to cast spells or do magic..."
"Before the sands run down, we must find the meaning of these accursed riddles!"
"Gwani cloaks are most rare, and are worn by the Goblins as a token of great bravery. I slew the chieftain who once wore this cloak!"
"To have many things unique to our race -- other than our appearance -- that distinguish us from humans. To be different, but also equal."
"I will accept this price." ~"I can always use the extra funds for research."
"Chad is a friendly fellow -- I like him."
"Now that I am Lord of the Bears, Monitor is at last safe from invasion."
"Is there a problem? Art thou confounded by thy task?"
"Ah, but thou dost tell that tale to everyone, Jendon. Thou canst not convict a man for listening to thy tales..."
"We now call it the Helm of Monitor, and it is worn by the Knight Champion. But it first came from the Goblins."
"Canst thou not see that we are trying to help thee! Everything that we say hath meaning. Thou must vanquish the foe..."
"I think perhaps he took a notion to leave and go adventuring. He had a strange sense of humor and a powerful temper..."
"I shall prepare a list."
"Far away, in the cold white north, There lives a vicious band."
"I cannot explain further. Dost thou not feel it? The sense that something is... not right?"
"The Leopards are the glue which holds this community together. We keep the Bears and Wolves from tearing each other apart."
"Urrgh..."
"Hast thou changed thy mind about meeting?"
"Sadly, I have lost the key, so I shall have to beg for forgiveness..."
"Come on, do not insult mine intelligence. Surely thou dost know what a Sultan is! Canst not thou see mine harem?"
"My personal specialty is spells involving healing and the sustenance of life energies."
"Free me and I shall help thee win free of this place!"
"'Tis good to hear that thou art well. Do not hesitate to come and see me if thou dost need healing of any kind."
"Delphynia is Fawn's horticulturist and healer, of late. I met her when I accompanied Batlin into town for supplies."
"Aaahh, a fine weapon a war hammer is. There's nothing quite like the feeling of whacking someone with a mallet."
You kiss Nastassia and she moans.
"I have waited many years for this moment. I thank thee, Master!"
"Well done, my friend! You are truly an Avatar!"
"Very good," he says, noticeably relieved. "I thank thee in advance."
"Thou art carrying too much. Come back and I will give thee thy paper when thou art not so greatly encumbered."
"Art thou trying to jest with me? Thou dost not have 40 guilders!"
"Batlin was right. We cannot hope to survive if Unity is not brought to this place."
"And I do not know how to change him back!"
"Hurd and Ivor work the mines night and day. Beryl cooks and cleans. They are good workers. They shall make me wealthy."
"Thou must find a way to make the thing denounce Kylista and the Great Captains, and overthrow this evil system!"
"But thou already knowest!"
"I thank thee for telling me that thou hast seen it... But if thou dost have it, thou mayest keep it."
"It is a comfort to know that my daughter is among the monks. Yet I have a foreboding..."
"The Lady of Fawn gave me a necklace to give to thee, my love. But in all my trials to find thee, I seem to have lost it."
"May I see?"
"A stone platform hidden in the Crypts..."
"To hone their skills, our Knights meet daily on the List Field to spar. Thus, they demonstrate their martial prowess."
"That is because thou canst not swim, Petra."
You feel your Cube vibrate, but somehow you know that Mandy would have told you the truth without it.
"Surely thou hast heard about the murders of Frederico and Tania?!"
"For a gold coin I will tell thee another. Dost thou wish to hear it?"
"Well, mayhap next time thou wilt be willing."
"Forgive me. I have no questions for thee."
"When thou hast completed the Test, then there will be a great banquet held for thee!"
"Ahh, Smith, the Guardian hath been stopped. Everything is safe."
"Thou mayest tarry with us for as long as thou dost wish, but remember... The Sands of Time wait for no one, not even thee."
"Gustacio doth adhere too strictly to outdated codes of ethics. Why, we could accomplish nothing in Moonshade if we followed his advice!"
"The Council of Mages is the ruling body of Moonshade. I did not wish to accept a seat on the Council, but Columna persuaded me..."
"A rotten egg!" ~"Why art thou shoving such a thing at me?"
"Press the button, and thou canst see for thyself!"
"Avoid Brendann -- he sees women as trophies, to be won and then set on a shelf. He is shallow and insincere."
"Then I shall add to it."
"But be careful! There are many challenges for the unwary, and thou must survive to cleave Pomdirgun's head into two!"
"I am sorry, but thou dost not have enough guilders to purchase this!"
"There is a rival now -- The Fellowship. To know not if it is good or bad, but to know I do not follow it!"
"She is a very wise Emp. Many humans have been met by her. Knowledge and experience are her talents."
"Mayhap thou dost need to study more at the Hierophant's library. 'Tis a wondrous place full of the wisdom of Order."
"The Leopards are one of the three Commands of Monitor. They control the tower nearest Monitor itself."
"The coins are thine!"
"Wouldst thou like a room? Or wouldst thou like something to eat or drink? Just say so and I shall try and please thee with my delicacies."
"I have only dried roots in my supply -- if thou desirest fresh roots, thou must go into the swamp when the tides are right."
"The Crown Jewel just left here a short while ago. I do not know where it was headed."
"To only say that the Imbalance is growing worse. To fear that there will be no gargoyles left undreaming soon."
"'Tis a bear's skull. Bears are common in this area and to the south of here as well."
"Neither one of us knew that the other existed until after the death of our father."
"I fear that I must charge more, now that my raw materials are so limited."
"Dost thou have a gem for sale?"
"I do see some improvement in thee!"
"And who wouldst thou be?"
"If this is so, I cannot aid thee."
"Wouldst thou like more Fawnish ale?"
After a short while you notice that the edge has definitely improved.
"Avatar, when next we meet I shall wear thine eyeballs for earrings!"
"My father was a Knight, and a very good one. But he is dead now."
"Then thou shalt die with thy secret, Avatar..."
"I am now thy servant. What is thy bidding, master?"
"Merrick sleeps in the shelter run by The Fellowship. They feed him, too. He had to join before they would help him."
"Most excellent! We shall be to work immediately, and hope to have information very soon. Please return to me in a few hours."
"Which of you wishes to train?"
"I know not... Though I would hazard a guess that it refers to the forces of good and evil."
"Magic must be functioning properly now, Avatar. Use it wisely."
"Certainly..."
"I must return to Monk Isle."
"How many Words of Power are there?"
"Thou dost not have enough companions to carry thy reward! Thou must return to me later, and I will give thee thy gold."
"No one hath asked me my real name in several hundred years! I have always been called simply Phoenix."
"As a sign of her regret for what hath happened -- jail and all -- she sent three gifts to thee."
"Look what thy mad companion, Iolo, hath done to me! He told me to tell thee that only thou couldst prove whether Beauty was skin deep."
"Honey will be given by you to me?"
"If thou hast need of my services later, I will be here."
"I know that boy Tobias is innocent of any wrong doing, no matter what Feridwyn and his Fellowship says."
"I am reluctant to admit this, but under the circumstances, I think that I must."
"Sounds good ta me!"
"There are merchants and laborers, as well as a few new folks."
"His attacks have grown more daring of late."
"The citizens of Monitor are all Knights, and they belong to one of three Commands: the Bears, Wolves, or Leopards."
"Although I think it would be foolish to catch her eye as long as Filbercio doth have an interest in her... If thou knowest what I mean."
Lord British hands you the deed to the ship, but it slips from your hands and falls to the floor.
"How I look forward to the day when the Goblins have been exterminated from this land!"
"I cannot help thee with that."
"Bah! Thou art only trying to taunt me! Leave me at once!"
"Alas, I cannot save thy friend. I will provide a proper burial. Thou must go on and continue with thine own life."
"I believe that thou hast already heard that one." ~"Wouldst thou like to hear it again?"
"I had hoped that the storms would end soon, before they cause us to close..."
"It doth not take a wizard to untangle this skein. Who among us acts strangely, doth do things in secret, and avoids his knightly duties?"
"We bring balance to the community. 'Tis not always glorious to be a Leopard, but we are proud to do our duty."
"We have plenty, if thou dost change thy mind!"
"I live here in the hold with my lady."
"He must be trying to get back on my good side after all of the times I have caught him wenching and carousing."
"We have been fighting the damn Goblins since our forefathers landed on these shores. This city was built on the site of a Goblin village."
"Thou dost know-- the bloke who wears a crown and acts like a king."
"Trent is in the smithy, not far from here, across the road."
"If thou dost want ta wet thy whistle, I can sell thee a fine drink -- Fawnish Ale. 'Tis a strong refreshment, though..."
"Might I take that..."
"How many dozen wouldst thou like?"
"Further meditation must be done before thou art ready to undertake the tests once more..."
She takes a ring from her slender finger and places it in your hand. You expect it to pass right through, but it rests neatly in your palm.
"And watch for the Ring, Necklace and Earring -- for by these, the Power shall guide thee."
"All right then, glad Oi could introduce ye to a few o' my friends."
"Well, perhaps I can find my way home on mine own... I am an Adept, after all."
"Oh, well. I had no choice but to ask."
"There is not much there, save for an ancient inn for which the village is named. Wilfred's brother Argus doth operate it."
The actor speaks in falsetto.
"My name? You can call me what you want, but I will only respond to Smith."
"Thou couldst not succeed without me!"
"If Gwenno were lost from me forever, perhaps I too would be a little confused."
Day 45 -- Women and children are finding gold nuggets.
You see a rather reserved-looking gargoyle.
"To know that my grandfather's ashes have been taken from the Crypts..."
"Thou must put away one of thine other items before thou canst take this fine piece of clothing."
Margareta takes your money.
"To be interested in another spell?"
"I be searchin' for a Mage to help me find my brother what was lost in the storms, if thou pleasest."
"Thou canst usually find her at the Capessi Canton."
Antique armour includes leather, metal scales, chain mail and metal plates. The sturdier the material, the greater the protection.
"I can give thee 2 filari for every 1 gold coin thou hast."
Day 40 -- Finding more wolves than gold.
"Thou art more destitute than I! If I tell thee any more jokes now thou mayest steal mine act!"
"How many times must ginseng be boiled before it becomes syrup?"
"I can see that thou dost need a strong arm like myself. Since it is thy wish, I shall come with thee."
"I cannot make thee a cloak without an animal's skin!"
"How many wouldst thou like?"
"What can I do for thee, Mr. Fool?"
"Did not faithful Sethys tell thee of my fate? I was slain on this very spot centuries ago, at the hands of the Soldiers of Order."
"The gargoyles have also succumbed to these afflictions. They have fallen into a deep state of dreaming."
"Oh, my. We truly do need the meat. Well, perhaps next time."
"But dost thou have proof?"
"Hmmm... In these trying times, I must charge steep prices or become a pauper."
"How many portions wouldst thou wish to sell?"
"I will tell thee about Lord British, The Fellowship, or Buccaneer's Den if thou bringest me the potion of invisibility."
"I charge 150 gold to train thee in the use of magic. Dost thou agree?"
"What dost thou think, Olon?"
"Indeed, this person is badly wounded. I will attempt to return them to health."
"With customers such as thou, I shall never make a profit..."
"Dost thou carry a pikeman's body for cremation?"
"Why 'tis progressing nicely, friend Forbrak."
"My mistress says that automatons are more trustworthy, since we can neither be corrupted nor tortured."
"Aye! It would be my pleasure!"
"I am still Tobias!"
"I am afraid I do not know of such a person."
"Use a cloth to soak up the blood..."
You see a wizened female ape-like creature.
"So, thou art the one whose arrival we have been awaiting."
"She raises the most lovely flowers that I have ever seen! Thou must see them to believe of their existence."
"I have not seen my colleagues since they were last here. They are busy folk."
"I know what any non-Monitorian knows..."
"It is nice to meet thee."
"I want to attain a higher level of acceptance in The Fellowship. I want to hear the 'voice'. That is mine one true goal."
"Gwenno..."
"Thou wilt find no better rates..."
"Oh, and did I mention that he had several underlings travelling with him? There was a warrior, a sailor, and a hooded man."
"The Fellowship has branches all over Britannia. It is a most popular philosophical society."
"Dost thou accuse me?"
"I have never heard of such a rock. Who doth care about rocks?"
"Perhaps I misjudged thee, master." He pauses for a thoughtful moment, "Mayhap in time thou canst call me friend as well as ally."
"Rocco is the innkeeper at the Blue Boar. He's a gruff man, whose sole pleasure in life seems to be haggling. Well, besides Petra, that is."
"To have returned! To be glad to see you again, human," says Teregus. "To be welcome to the house of the altars. To be helpful to you?"
This is a tall, skinny actor with knobby knees.
"Very well, then. Of whom wouldst thou speak?"
"This is a town of fighters who pass their time fighting each other in bloody duels. It is no place for me. I should never have left Minoc!"
"A Passion Play is a morality tale performed on stage."
"Who said that! Death draws near for those who taunt Rotoluncia the Red Witch."
"Let us go and find Shamino and make this a proper reunion!"
"To purchase what item?"
"That is a Goblin hairbrush! Made out of the bones of their victims, or so the legends claim."
If this lasts I will have to make more dried meat.
"Wouldst thou like something else?"
"Thou hast killed the jackal?"
"Now, do not speak of Leon's followers in such a manner! We of Fawn have learned tolerance, thanks to the Lady's example."
"Master... Punishment... No Order..."
"Why dost thou not give it to me?"
"I like the last one best... 'Tis fun to guess what will be there after the flash."
"Mmmm. What a delicacy! It is the most wonderful delicacy that thou shalt ever eat! It is worth every gold piece spent."
"That worm hath been following thee? Then he doth suspect that thou art allied with the Cause..."
"Never saw any use fer it meself. I kin make me own light... Wit'out mussin' up me hair! Ha!"
"Why art thou in such a rush? In Moonshade, we know to mix pleasure with business."
"Welcome back..."
"A better time to buy would be when my shop is open."
"Speak with Yenani or Baiyanda. They know what to do."
"Then I shall certainly not let thee in."
"Avatar, didst thou deliver the package to Elynor of Minoc?"
"I never thought that I would rue the day that another intelligent being learned the truths of The Fellowship."
"How many times have I told thee to stay away from that thief, boy?! Dost thou think stealing is funny?"
"I would accept thy money if thou dost wish to purchase something."
"I am the provisioner of Serpent's Hold."
One bird in thine hand is better than two birds in the bush.
"I no longer believe in names. Doth the corn in the field have a name? Canst thou hear the cry of the corn?"
"Serpent's Hold is located at precisely 53 degrees east and 165 degrees south."
"Speak to Daphne or Ophelia at the Bunk and Stool, our town pub and inn."
"It assists me in mine attempts to keep a watchful eye on my father... He hath not been right since my mother, Elissia, died."
"I beg thy pardon, MageLord Filbercio, but I have an urgent message for thee."
"Well, if thou keepest thy promise to release me, I'll be free of that lice-ridden, flea-bitten, old mage."
"Thou dost not have enough gold for that!"
"But I don't understand. How didst thou survive the Knight's Test? We fixed the place with traps to be absolutely fatal!"
"Petra is a fine girl, even if she's merely a magical construct."
"I must be about my duties."
"The Colored Storms and the Goblins have kept most people off the roads, and so 'tis unusual to see strangers in Monitor."
"A beautiful city, is it not? But ever so much more beautiful at night when the moon is shining down upon it. Dost thou not agree?"
"The prosperity of Monitor is due to the foresight of the Wolves. They have forced us to reach out to our fellow Man."
"I have been rejected by the woman I love."
"Of course, now that thou hast destroyed the tetrahedron all magic has been restored. I congratulate thee for thine heroic deed!"
"I suppose that is what comes of not knowing the difference between Leopards, Bears and Wolves..."
"Mine only hope for survival is to find a champion who could stand up to the fiercest fighters in Jhelom."
"Well, thou knowest... private places!"
"What is thy name?"
"I must have misunderstood. I thought we had an agreement."
"I thank thee most enthusiastically! It will be our little secret then."
"To be unsure but to think it has something to do with a woman and, to say how... sex?"
"Who? Oh, he is a local boy who comes in here and moons over me on occasion. Do not concern thyself with him. I do not."
"I believe he is in Jhelom."
"Perhaps Alyssand could help thee. She is a good hand at weaving the stockings that are found hereabouts."
"Please make up thy mind!"
"I see that coward Sprellic has given thee the flag so that it may be returned to us. Thou hadst better hand it over."
"Oh, am I glad to see thee! I have been very scared."
"So thou dost go there often?"
"The Bears suspect Krayg the Provisioner of being involved, but the Wolves deny it -- of course!"
"What dost thou say to this?"
"Morz and I grew up together. He is very sensitive about his stutter, though, so I would not bring it up."
"One of the Temple guards is sympathetic to our Cause. He hath given me this key, which will lead thee into the hidden parts of the Temple."
You see a young, wiry teen.
"Between Brunt, the idiot, and Deadeye, the one-eyed pirate, I am lucky still to be alive..."
"Such a man hardly sounds like the servant of Daemons, innkeeper."
"And 'tis no mean feat for us poor Rangers to overcome something that overpowered a Mage, I can tell thee!"
"All my brothers and sisters called me 'Boots' when I was a baby, and it hath remained my name ever since."
"Thou wert wise to pick up that torch! We need all that we can find, for they do not burn for long."
"Takes after his old man, I must say. He is sure to be a great actor. Or writer. Or director. Or producer."
"More snakes! Destroy the vile creatures, Avatar!"
"Wonderful! I hope that this means that the storms will end soon..."
"The Daemon British enforced a radical scheme of philosophy upon his subjects, forcing them into exile if they would not submit."
"I do not believe that caging souls was possible within Britannia. Therefore, the spell must have come from this land."
"I am not sure that I care to speak about the incident. 'Twas most unpleasant."
"I am Kliftin."
"Her heart was broken, ever since that Warlock from Moonshade stole her oldest daughter!"
"I do not believe we've met. I'm Rocco, the innkeeper at the Blue Boar."
"As the leader of the Leopards, this is my year to rule Monitor."
"Open the door to their private chambers and let them show thee how much they'd like thee to stay..."
"Shall we continue thy report?"
Frosting:~ Frost with a mixture of confectioner's sugar (1 1/2 cup) and 5 teaspoons of milk.
"What is it?"
"How else did the Goblins surprise the entire patrol? Astrid was no fool. Someone betrayed her."
"Where is thine honor? What of our agreement?"
"Nor did I!"
"Thou art already as proficient as I. Thou mightest consider consulting one of the other trainers that specialize in other areas."
You see a man whose wrinkled face forms a caricature of grumpiness.
"To not need curing!"
"I see a scroll. Perhaps it contains clues about this place, or counsel for our future adventurings."
"Ah, thy mind is questing again! What shall we speak of now?"
"That may be, but I must test thy knowledge before I permit thee access to the grand shrine."
"To be the tavernkeeper. To be very strong of body, and of mind."
"There is something about him that reminds me of my stepmother! Call it crazy if thou wilt!"
"'Tis hard to offer lower prices these days. The Goblins have hurt everyone's business."
"Me Pomdirgun, Warlord and King of all Goblins. Mine shall be last name thou wilt ever hear."
"Good man. He is our branch leader here in Trinsic."
"I am sorry, Harnna, but if the Goblins have her, she is lost. There is not an ounce of mercy or remorse within them."
"Be still, Luther -- I think something strange is happening. Tell me more of what thou didst see..."
"What can I do for thee?"
"Verily, thou hath a good head upon thy shoulders!"
"I did find the necklace lying in the throne room."
"Well, actually I am in here for not paying my taxes. After all, I... earned the money, why should I give it to the Britannian Tax Council?"
"Greetings, felon!"
"Ah, a sweet savior! No fairer face hath a warrior worn."
"Thou cannot possibly carry that much!"
"Must we? Very well..."
"I smell something... thou hast some fish! Thou hast brought it for me! Oh, I do so love a good fish."
"Vanquished! By a mere mortal!"
"He great hunter. Mwaerno and Baiyanda joined by Yenani many years ago."
"I have many friends in Britannia. Among them are Greg, James, Brownie and Mack."
"The Wolves have this grand scheme for uniting the Three Cities into a commonwealth, united by trade routes."
"Please, may I see the stockings..."
Ethicality is the belief in abiding by rules of conduct.
"No, Luther is still the most likely suspect. Continue on thy quest to find the traitor, my friend. As thy commander, I order it."
"He spends all his time asleep or at the inn, except when he comes here to make me crazy with his nagging."
"His family doth own a shipping business. They have been merchant seamen for generations."
"Umm... I apologize for droning on and on. What wouldst thou like to speak about?"
"Tell me -- hast thou prepared the arrow? To defeat the tyrant Draygan?"
"To be an important part of my life. To support The Fellowship fully."
"I can give thee 100 monetari for any piece of jewelry thou hast."
"Thank thee!"
"My visage offends the good people of Fawn, and I have been forbidden entry into the city."
"Ha ha ha!!! Very funny. Take those little silver coins to Bull, and exchange them for true coin!"
"Be careful, Olon. There aren't many outside Fawn that care for its taste. I only export a bit ta Monitor now."
"Come to the museum when it is open!"
"Why even those benighted idiots, the Ophidians, knew ta expect ye. So it can't be such a shock ta ye."
"Thou dost not speak to an ordinary adventurer!" *"This is the Avatar!"
The man before you stretches and inhales deeply.
"Moonshade is on the Isle of Beyond, which is across the channel from Sleeping Bull. Thou wouldst need a boat to journey there."
"Thou wilt find no other moneychangers with such a low fee as mine!"
"For those who wish to hear of a lost civilization, I can tell thee of the people who left the ruins on this continent."
"'Tis a bloody war we are fighting. That I am alive, today, speaking with thee is a miracle."
"I am the Town Mayor of Cove, home of the Shrine of Compassion."
"It was such a quiet town until these murders happened. I cannot believe it."
"He is the town treasurer, and exchanges foreign coins for the good coins of Monitor."
"Then thou hadst better join me for one later. It will give thee the chance to catch up to me."
"I do not pretend to know what happened in the Knighthood Dungeon, but it sounds more like wizardry than Goblin mischief."
"Go thou and ask Delphynia, though. She collects odd things that she calls reagents. Perhaps she might know what that is."
Show respect for all life forms. Unless they do attack thee, spare them.
"Perhaps I shall speak with Lady Yelinda again. Surely, she doth need mine advice if this town is to be saved..."
"I am sorry, but thy wounds are not mortal. Perhaps thou canst visit me when my shop is open."
"Thank thee, Avatar! Thank thee for returning me to my former Beauty."
You see a mage with a wild look in his eyes.
"I thank thee for showing me these documents. Justice will be served. Thou mayest keep these documents if thou wishest."
"Why dost thou delay? Take the key that I gave thee, and enter the hidden places within the Temple."
"The virtues are: Tolerance, Ethicality, Enthusiasm, Discipline, Emotion and Logic."
"I keep villains and knaves out of Trinsic and keep a record of all who leave. Thou must have a password to leave."
"Thou dost suspect The Fellowship of foul deeds? Well then! Thou art perceptive indeed! Perhaps we are working toward the same goal!"
"Welcome, Avatar."
"She left here for the east. To study at the library on Monk Isle, as I recall."
"Wouldst thou like to buy something?"
"I would like to give Chuckles a black eye!"
"Even Rocco would consider this a fair deal..."
"Thou dost not have enough gold to train here."
"So we set sail from Sosaria, and -- led beyond the Serpent Pillars by a mage named Erstam -- we came to the Serpent Isle."
"I grow vegetables to feed the town, and sometimes to trade. What dost thou wish to purchase?"
"Sounds like a love story ta me..."
The woman greets you with a curtsey.
"For which game dost thou want to hear the rules?"
"If I cannot remain here, I shall go home to the inn. Thou canst always find me there."
"Thou wilt reconsider when thou dost hear what the Guardian said..."
Arcadion looks as if he's about to force his way through the mirror, then once again masters his incredible rage.
"Then why didst thou mention it? Leave me alone!"
"Frederico and Tania were killed at the Minoc sawmill in a manner most gruesome."
"At least we do not have to do what Merrick does. He recruits for The Fellowship."
"Only mages approved of by the Council of Mages may sell death spells. And the Council must be notified of all research and experiments."
"Perhaps thou mayest buy such things from Krayg, our town's provisioner. But I doubt that even he would carry such footwear."
"To be fine."
"Vas Ort Rel Tym..."
You see a mage with a peaceful look in his eyes.
"I understand. I can not blame thee for not being interested. It is not a particularly fascinating topic."
"Now there is a disgusting creature for thee. I think they were better named back when we called them daemons!"
"I can give thee 50 gold coins for every gem thou dost have."
"How many dost thou want?"
"The Mages and Rangers were bound by the travesty known as the Oath of Honesty!"
"I am the Trinsic branch leader for The Fellowship. I work here with my wife Ellen."
"Wouldst thou care for more?"
"The password is @Iskatradeeth@."
"Before we go any farther, Avatar, I think we should take stock of our supplies."
"Why, I do not know what she is talking about! I work late, that is all!"
"Until thou dost bring proof, no one will believe thee, including myself!"
"Anyone knows that goblins devour people! Why soon before the storms began, they abducted the healer who was gathering herbs."
You see a swarthy gypsy with soulful eyes, dressed in colorful clothes. He looks as if he has the weight of the world on his shoulders.
"Do not worry so, old friend. We shall find thy wife soon enough."
"What dost thou say to this?"
Your old friend Nicodemus has a far away look in his eyes.
"I must be about my duties. Perhaps we can discuss this another time, my friend."
"Trulacci, whose ill-fated son now languishes in the depths of the Mountains of Freedom."
"$Temp3Flag was set to true."
"I can do thee a favor as well. Wouldst thou like to buy one of these beautiful apples for the merest pittance of five gold coins?"
"What is it?"
"Within the Hourglass of Fate lie the Sands of Time. As each grain doth fall, so doth another moment hasten us to our doom."
"The bouquet is thine!"
"I hope that thou dost like our fine city of Moonshade."
"So if thou dost seek favors, From the Forest Master fierce, Thou shouldst be prepared to return to him The Orb of Elerion."
"I am certain thou wilt enjoy our food and drink."
"I am the Lord of Monitor, the City of Knights."
"If thou art ready to see thy friend again, thou hast merely to ask and I will return them to thee."
"I don't know about thee, Drusilla, but I think that lout would do well as a candlestick. What thinkest thou?"
"I thought it nothing more than a trinket... Passed down from the Lady Fawn herself, granted, but a bauble nonetheless."
"Wilt thou buy me a drink? I would be glad ta share stories with thee if thou dost."
"Now the two are sundered, and Fawn cares for no one but herself."
"Why, Silverpate is the one who built this inn!"
"Well, I do not know if thou art aware, but we are having many problems with magic in general, and with the Moongates."
"He planned to destroy the Wolves! And the Bears! And to make himself King of the city!"
"Such perfidy makes my blood run cold. Have the Priestess jailed until I decide what fate she deserves!"
"He is probably at the dock right now."
"He was a rather portly man, if I remember rightly. He had been here once before..."
"None now. But 'til I made this mine home, I was a sailor, a... privateer, out of Buccaneer's Den."
"Of course, this was before the Storms. No sailor will brave these dangerous waters now."
"I am truly sorry, but I do not think that I can help thee..."
"But now, the rumors of a gathering Goblin invasion have scared the travellers off the roads! Frankly, this is nonsense."
"Why, yes. I sense that the spirit of Caine has not left the island yet. Is he not waiting for thy return?"
"And," she adds, "I also have a ship for sale shouldst thou be interested in that."
"Wouldst thou be willing to pay a fine of 30 Monetari?"
"The passageway is sealed with an iron door, but thou shalt find the key tied around my neck."
"I think this talk of a traitor in Monitor is all rather speculative. Surely, no one suspects anyone at this table of being a Goblin spy."
"Here in Paws the people have very little money, but it matters not, because they care for each other."
"If the Goblins refuse to concede that this territory belongs to us, then what else shall we do? Sue for peace?!"
"They make me itch so I do not wear any."
"Art thou ready to answer questions from the Book of Fellowship?"
Trent continues his work on the strangely-shaped iron cage.
"Thou wishest to purchase my ship 'The Nymphet'? The deed will cost thee 600 gold."
"Thou shalt not find me such easy prey, mighty Avatar!"
"I will do so with haste. I have duties which need attending."
"Use the sense that the heavens gave thee... If a storm starts, seek shelter. 'Tis simple enough."
Dawn already. What a chill bleak morning.
"What a strange color -- a greenish bolt, I'd say."
"They have gone to Fellowship Headquarters in Britain. They were here delivering Fellowship funds. Their names are Elizabeth and Abraham."
"Something is coming to me... a thought... a premonition..."
"My father died in the Great Forest there. Some wild animal or something killed him. Art thou perhaps travelling to Yew?"
"Thou art not permitted here! I and my kind are the only beings allowed to prowl these tunnels. We are here to maintain Order."
"Wands, crystal balls... things like that."
"Here they are..."
"He came to the Fellowship camp. We spoke privately."
You notice that Nicholas' diaper is wet.
"But perhaps Delphynia could help thee. She uses all manner of fancy equipment to prepare her herbs for healing and such."
"Oh, I think thou dost not really know!"
"Now I would like to hear from our members who have gathered here this evening. Share with us how The Fellowship has helped thee!"
"I good hunter. Catch many things."
"Yes, they are likely to keep me in them the next time until I rot. Or, at the very least, until I die from the troll's lashings."
"It is lonely to be MageLord. I have the needs of a normal man, yet I am overwhelmed by the demands of the citizens..."
"Gone! In a trice! No word to anyone..."
"Thou wilt forgive me if I remain skeptical a bit longer. One does not attain a position such as mine by being overly trusting."
"Even now, Kylista refuses us refuge within the city walls."
"So, thou hast come to rescue thy friend? Well, thou must kill me first -- I have the only key to his cell!"
"However, thy certain knowledge concerning this traitor is vital if the Oracle is to hear a complete accounting."
"'Tis not enough!"
"Thou dost already possess more skill than I could teach thee!"
"Yes, I get them for my mother."
"Also, please take this serpent tooth as a token of mine appreciation."
"Surely thou dost remember Cove. It is a very pleasant town to the east of Britain. Quite relaxing."
A pinecone (or, at least, it appears to be one).
"Concern thyself not with him. I shall deal with him later!"
"I yield the floor to Her Graciousness, the Lady Yelinda..."
"Thou art a shrewd and crafty bargainer, to convince me to accept this price..."
"I do not recall many details. Thou shouldst ask Patterson, the town mayor, about it. He may remember more."
"What wouldst thou like to buy?"
"Meat is without a good taste," she shudders. "It is not preferred!"
"I think that Petra's presence at the Blue Boar doth do much for Torrissio's reputation..."
"Well now, like I said before, I have never visited the other towns. But I have heard tell of them."
"Failure in Brendan2Usable(_Action, $Temp2Flag) because we //$ couldn't find the door."
"Burnside is my name."
An inexpensive shield, sturdy and suitable for battle.
I stood all night working on a few formulas.
"He acts like a swaggering noble, with all his self-important ambition."
"I am here... to guard the Shrine... of Love."
"Thou didst solve my first two riddles. Dost thou want to hear another riddle?"
"That bag of wind! Calls himself a sailor... Ha!"
"I am a merchant who operates one of the most thriving businesses in Paws, which includes the slaughterhouse."
"Merely a spar then? All right, good enough...."
You see an angelic young woman who gives you a smile of complete innocence.
"Dost thou want me to repeat everything I know about the murder?"
"Why would anyone bother with going anywhere beyond Monitor? This is where Courage thrives -- out there, frivolity reigns..."
"To believe that only the noblest Hero could retrieve such an object."
"But I would like to return the key to the Chaos Hierophant. Perhaps it would not hurt to go to the Temple of Enthusiasm, briefly."
"A letter from Freli! Oh, what joy!"
"To learn its meaning, translate it from the language of Magic."
"Batlin! Guardian! I await thee in the Void!"
"Once thou hast the blood, thou must use the blood on the Stoneheart. This produces the Bloodspawn that thou wilt need for death spells."
"Fellow member! How art thee! I hope thy journey to Buccaneer's Den was not too troublesome! Welcome to our island!"
The friendly-looking monk signals you over to him.
"Lord Marsten was the traitor, and that worm Spektor aided him! Death would be too kind for them!"
"Now they watch me closely -- but not closely enough!"
"Remember, if thou canst find thy way out, thou wilt be free!"
"We meet again."
You kiss Nastassia and she moans.
"We have not seen them since. Although they promised to return soon."
"Thou hast not enough guilders for my rooms."
"Mayhaps, stranger. But nothing half so strange..."
"My real name is Stuart. My stage name is Laurence."
"If thou changest thy mind, thou hast but to return and ask again."
"Ah, I know just the one for a bold wench as thyself! A tale ta stir the blood, that's for certain... the King of the White Dragon!"
"Thou shouldst not argue with me only to change thy mind when we have agreed to a firm price!"
"I hope to see thee there during business hours."
"Here they are."
"It sounds intriguing. I shall discover, if only for an instant, what it is to truly be human."
"I can give thee 40 filari for every 1 gold nugget thou hast."
"Shh! Don't let Olon hear what price thou didst pay. He would never let me hear the last of it!"
"But how shall I gain the gold, if thou dost not aid me?"
"No, master... I am a Mundane apprentice."
"Go now, and regain the Helm!"
"I see no reason to discuss this matter with someone who is not even a Knight."
"As promised, I will send thee to my shipmate, Scots."
"I'm certain that thou hast many yarns ta tell. Wert thou amongst the company that retook the tower?"
"Thou hast no doubt heard by now the news? That Shamino doth live again! The monks brought him to us."
"I'd spit on her grave, if she had one, the hag!"
"She is my wife and bookkeeper for our branch."
"I think I am in the right key..."
"And it was all I could do to keep Rabindrinath's insanity from destroying us."
"Oh, I thank thee from the bottom of mine heart for thy kindness and thy bravery!"
"What weapon dost thou favor?"
"Fawn, the city of Beauty. Fawn, the city that lost Love in vanity and the pursuit of power."
"I am the foreman of the Minoc mine."
"I am sure thou wilt love them."
"Oh! One of thy friends hath met an untimely end. This should not be..."
"But I sense that thou art somehow different, milord."
"Just the practice Leavell has had in fending off jealous husbands 'twould make any man a master combatant!"
"It might please thee to know that there is good news!"
"How wouldst thou feel, if all that thou hadst strived for were given to a man who had done nothing to deserve it?"
"A young, untrained Mage can be quite dangerous! Therefore, these children must be brought to the Seminarium -- for their own safety!"
"That is not the correct password! Thou art forbidden to enter!"
"Yes, I just enchanted it."
"Once again, thou hast proved thyself to be the love of my life. When I write my book, I shall dedicate it to thee, my love."
"It's in the southwest corner of town."
"I must confess that in mine humility, it never occurred to me that the Hierophant even knew my name!"
"Dost thou find the rate acceptable?"
"Bring it to me, and I shall inspect it! It might be from one of my experiments..."
"She hath some strange habits, need I say more. The MageLord protects her, for she is his latest paramour."
"If Battles had not spotted that approaching storm we would have all been dead men for certain!"
"Thou art my savior! I shall await thy return eagerly."
"It hath been a pleasure, friend! Enjoy thy purchase!"
"Do not thy companions dear to thine heart call thee Avatar?"
"Hmph! A lazy lout he was, as well. We shall not miss him!"
"Ah, well, thou art carrying too much. I will simply have to save it for when I have time to talk with her. Thank thee anyway."
"As long as those humans stay out of my domain I shall reciprocate by not trespassing upon theirs."
"From a horse? Right! Like I've got some to give you."
Trent seems to be searching for something.
"I thank thee, Avatar."
"What wouldst thou like to buy?"
"To direct you to Sir Denton, the tavernkeeper at the Hallowed Dock. To know more about the Hold and the people than I."
"Yurel does not care. Yurel here now, and must find a way home. Yurel only wants to live... Do not others feel the same way?"
"Those colors are the hues worn by the Monitorians. The shield must have come from a pikeman."
"Yurel wishes only to be left in peace... and to go home."
"I recognize this! This is the ornamental breastplate that I made for Kylista, priestess of Fawn."
"No? What hast thou been doing with my chickens? Art thou some kind of fowl pervert?"
"Why, if I accepted such a price as this, I may as well sell the inn ta Olon!"
"Thus, both Chaos and Order were doomed!"
"Told him ta go talk ta others of his ilk, not badger the honest folk."
"Just wait until I tell her father about this! He and Mara will certainly take care of the situation.!"

"Here is another tooth. It will allow thee to travel back to this island. Although, I trust that it shall not be necessary to do so."
"To accept?"
"Thou art poisoned! Fortunately, the poison can easily be removed from thy body."
"Bah! They concern me not!"
"There is a tale that explains his absence."
"The Blue Boar is a tavern here. It provides food and lodging at a reasonable rate... for Moonshade."

"Place it not in my face! That bottle is filthy..."
"Legend claims that the Lady keeps a Daemon shrine locked away in a secret room of her palace. Hard to believe, eh?"
"I fear that the Great Captains urged her to leniency in favor of their common ties with the sea."
"And the other, as I have said, was a tall hooded man -- No one recalls hearing him speak at all. So perhaps he is mute."
"Pray, resolve thy mind!"
"The true criminals are Priestess Kylista and Great Captain Voldin, who have conspired to convict this innocent man!"
"Aram-Dol is not easily reached. The liche hath surrounded his lair with many creatures."

You see a salty old sailor who reeks of tobacco.
"Thou shalt be my door warden. I can count on thy strength to delay the Avatar..."
"The other... He was a thief who wore a face none could love. He stole mine heart away!"
"I love that man! Dupre, sing that drinking song thou didst teach me, the one about all the young ladies?"
"I thank thee for thy decency and consideration."
"Thou shouldst inquire if anyone is missing a shield."
"He hath grown lazy with prosperity, however -- his apprentice doth do most of the hard labor, while the Master wets his throat at the inn!"

"Rotoluncia shall avenge my loss..."
"It is all contained within the notebook."
"How doth that sound?"
"Tsk tsk... I am broken-hearted..."
"Ha! Shmed was the worst coward in Monitor. We let him hide in Knight's Test to spare ourselves the agony of exiling him."
Balance as thine enemy.
"What article wouldst thou like to buy?"
Thou shalt not say with thy tongue that which thou wouldst not make good with thine actions.
"Then I shall challenge the Goblins to a final battle, and use their pathetic skulls for the sharpening of my blade!"
"Thou hast not the gold for that!"
"Thou art so encumbered! Let me give some of this to thy friends."
"If thou dost not want to sell, 'tis fine by me."
"Truly thou art the bravest Monitorian alive!"
"Then thou hast spent too much time on the list fields, and not enough time pondering the traditions of our people. Pay attention!"
"Instead, I could be crafting another masterpiece, so that my name will be known to future generations. This is true glory."
"Some other night, then."
"My name is Lucilla."
"What!? What dost thou mean? Art thou calling me a traitor? I may not be much of a fighter, but I can defend myself!"
"Thou must return when the Farmer's Market is open."
"Thou wishest to purchase one of my fine sextants? 'Twill cost thee 40 gold."

"Flicken is one of the Bear Command. He may seem argumentative, but he is simply a good fellow, doing his job."

"I have one last hope for thee, but I must first share a secret with thee..."
"Pwah! Monitorians do not need magic -- especially not magic weapons!"
"Ah. Too bad. To be waiting long for news from him."
"There. It is done. Now take the blasted thing to Mordra. She will instruct thee in its use."
"Thou dost not have enough monetari to purchase this!"
"I am so glad that thou hast met me here, sweet Avatar. I find strangers..."

"I am Miggim, the librarian here on Monk Isle."
"What dost thou say to this?"
"I believe that I can be of help..."
"Although we may lose our lives, we are reborn from the ashes of our own funeral pyres."

"The criminal must be a Mage!"
"I have good news for thee, my friend! As promised, I have arranged for thee to meet with MageLord Filbercio."

"It is not madness, Rocco. I am proud of thee..."
"Cellia is the tanner and furrier in town. I know nothing of such things."

"Again?! When is Stefano not in trouble?"
"For those with an adventurous spirit, I can tell thee of the northern savages."
"Wouldst thou care for more?"
"I shall give thee this cage to hold the bird within."
"What did he say?!"
You see a farmer who, despite showing considerable wear from hard work, appears energetic, cheerful and friendly.
You see a weary-looking man who is missing his right arm. With his one hand he scratches his head and squints in your general direction.
"I help father with the shop when he is... indisposed. What dost thou wish to purchase?"
At your approach, the woman raises her eyebrows to indicate she is aware of your presence and interested in what you are about to say.
"Do not worry, old friend! I shall try to save thee a drop or two." *"But thou shouldst be quick, lest I forget..."
"I beg thee, let me explain the concepts which propel the Cause. When thou dost understand, thou wilt surely join us..."
"Please be seated, Frigidazzi. We shall now hear from the character witnesses."
"Art thou from this land, from New Sosaria?"
"Wilt thou leave?"
He coughs into the rag he had just been using to polish the bar.
"Art thou a spy? Come, friends, we must kill the spy sent by the Hierophant of Order!"
"But I would prefer to talk about Brion."
"I cannot tell one gargoyle from another. I could not identify him, except that he had no wings."

Day 108 -- No one can be trusted.
"The Serpent was their sign."
"It gives revelations throughout the day."
"If thou wouldst come to my shop during the day, I could sell thee something..."
"I think that perhaps I should remain where I am..."
"Mine only regrets are that I did not try to steal something bigger and that I did not get away with it."
"Yet here we are on the ship. I wonder if I lost anything..."
"Thou art carrying too much!"
"Darling! This is such a surprise... I have an explanation for everything..."
"I am Cubolt of Moonglow."
"We also make fine wine that is sold throughout all of Moonshade."
"Only one man can help thee. The Forest Master could guide thee to King's Savior -- but beware him! He possesses strange powers."
"I fear that thy work hath only begun. Batlin's deeds have only worsened the storms."

"I am not even a drinking man. But Luther is known to imbibe to excess..."
"I am called Snaz."
"He was once a master of all things metal. Now all he does, so I am told, is work endlessly on that blasted cage!"
You see a helpful and efficient-looking woman.
"Ah, yes, now I remember. I thank thee."
"Go in peace, stranger. I wish thee well on thy quest."
"Bring to me the Dream Crystal and we will all be freed."
Day 22 -- We were forced to kill a pair of wolves near the encampment.
"Shanda says he wants something to eat!"
"Take the Chaos Stone from my dead body... it shall be the token that thou needest to summon the shade..."
"Now the fields are dying, as the blight spreads throughout the land. The storms leach the life from the land, and the crops fail."
"'Tis a terrible thing to be happening in our town, these murders. Minoc was once a safe and quiet place."
"But enough of these desperate accusations from a known criminal."
"As for old Voldin, I think he is not greatly missed."
"What art thou talking about? Thou dost know nothing! Leave at once, or I shall call the Pikemen!"
"Another spell perhaps?"
"I am the Head Servant at the castle. My job consists of keeping the other servants in line and serving the meals."
"What did the key open?"

"I can hardly do justice to the tale -- thou shouldst speak to Lord Marsten."
"How nice! A helper! Please, feel free to start work at any time!"
"As a favor to me, please continue searching for the spy. Surely, conclusive evidence shall appear sooner or later..."
"I am the judiciary part of Britannia's government. It is my job to see that criminals are brought to justice."
"Dost thou accuse me?"
"Ah, place it there on the trapdoor on top of the Cremator. I will pay thee after thou hast performed the last rites for the fallen one."
"I help mine husband Feridwyn run The Fellowship's shelter in Paws."
"The Fellowship can give thee purpose ~To join is thine only choice ~Commit thyself to our just cause ~And find thine inner voice."
"Very well..."
"What a wondrous man of insight he is!"
"I believe I remember it..."
"Everything I serve is delicious. I highly recommend that thou tasteth the Silverleaf dish. Worth every gold piece spent!"
"To tell you gargoyles reproduce differently than humans seem to, but to explain too poorly to be useful."
"Then I shall stay."
"So thou hast searched Rotoluncia's manor, and there is no sign of thy friend, or of Rotoluncia? How interesting..."
"Is there something else thou mayest wish to buy?"
"First, thou must have a ritual blood-letting device... Most mages possess one, even though they are technically illegal."
"He can explain the rules of the Test to thee, or thou couldst speak with Caladin. 'Tis Caladin's duty to instruct Knight candidates."
"Enjoy thy purchase!"
"Well, it shall cost thee 3 gold coins. Still want one?"
"You had best not do that, Avatar!"
"To tell you there is no such thing as a daemon. To be sure that Daemons are creatures from stories, used to frighten young ones."
"...And go to the southeast corner of the Throne Room. Seek the illusionary wall -- it will reveal the path to the treasure thou dost seek."
"Owings, have a look at that schedule and find out how we are doing."
"Now that I have seen thee, I think they are all wrong." ~"Thou art the most wondrous beauty I have seen."
"I hope thou dost realize that thou art getting a bargain with this price."
"Here is the Crystal Rose of Love..."
"There is no one else that I can trust such a secret to." *"If there be a way, some day I will go to him."
"It is located in the center of the Lake of Enchantment, south and west of where we now stand."
"Oh, it is my friend! Hast thou brought me something? No, I suppose not..."
"They say he rose from the dead. They think he is looking for revenge."
"I am the leader of the Command of the Wolf. Like all of the Wolves, I am a warrior of cunning as well as strength."
"I'm glad thou art returned."
"Art thou a Mage, Topo?"
"Did I not tell thee to speak with Gustacio?"
"Canst thou not see that I am trying to sleep!"
"Those Mages did not create a magical item! They summoned some beautiful spirit and trapped it there!"
"But I would drop everything to join thy group if thou art not too encumbered."
"Farmer Mack's chickens lay plenty of eggs. It is a good thing the people here have such healthy appetites!"
"Be still, Voldin. Thou hast been brought low, even as I have."
"Since we dare not stray too far from shelter, Scots cannot explore and map."
"'Tis not an ordinary scroll, but one of the magical variety. I assure thee that it is entirely free of harmful magic."
"I personally did not see it, but I know that Gustacio did."
"I sell a complete line of armour and weapons."
"Dost thou wish thy belongings returned to thee?"
"Mistress Devra is a sweet-natured lady. Too good-hearted to be an innkeeper sometimes."
"They were the two Fellowship officials that were here! They only stayed for a minute or two. I have no idea where they are now."
"Continue on thy quest. Trouble not thyself for this girl, as we shall do all that is possible for her."
"Our hunt bad."
All through these interminable weeks in this cage, I have suffered from chronic weariness.
"Thou must just learn The Game and then jump in and play it!"
"He hath worked from existing maps that he received from the Fawn fishermen, so he is only sure of the accuracy of the coastline."
"What... Oh! Forgive me, milords and ladies."
"Yet I can think. I can reason. And I believe I can care for others."
"Master Astelleron -- we actually called him our father -- created him before he did me. And he instilled Bollux with a personality first."
"My tale is a strange one. It may disturb and puzzle thee. Art thou certain thou wouldst like to hear it?"
"I shall have thine head for this outrage!"
"I have a prophecy for thee, Avatar."
"I wonder how he will react to seeing me again. I hope he hath not strayed too far from home."
"It is difficult to explain. He seems more disciplined," he gives a short laugh, "which, of course, is rather fitting for the Hold."
"Vas An Ort Ailem!"
"Deadeye is the only one of Batlin's companions that I truly know. I cannot say that I'm happy about the association, either."
"I am known as the Time Lord."
"And I am here, both as the Lord of Monitor, and as the leader of the Leopards."
"I am the advisor at the Lycaeum."
"How many dozen wouldst thou like?"
"Yes, master."
"Perhaps thou art in league with the enchanter who materialized in the center of town! We promptly jailed him."
"I believe he said -- Curse you all, and Beast British shall drink thy blood..."
"As thou dost wish... What else shall we speak of?"
"Thy concern for this young woman is well warranted, I fear."
"Now that thou hast completed the Test of Knighthood, thou must bring me the body of the animal thou didst slay."
"Ah, place them one at a time on the trapdoor on top of the Cremator." *"I will pay thee after each one receives the final rites."
"Right now I am not at work so please do not address me as if I were."
"What wouldst thou like to buy?"
"I knew that such fine work was possible. But I had never actually seen the stockings they sell in Moonshade."
You see a young woman with an intellectual bearing.
"They brought thee here along their way to Britain."
"The City of Beauty lies due north of here, on the shores of a great bay. Fawn is a city of fishermen."
"Too bad! If thou dost find any, please keep me in mind!"
"I have never seen any myself. I have no idea what it does to someone, but it cannot possibly be good!"
"Unfinished... Discipline..."
"Oh. All right. We know that thou art very busy. We shall find another way to deliver the bill. Thank thee anyway."
"Thou dost not have enough gold for that!"
"Say, dost thou think that Boris could have meant to give this locket to someone else?"
"He must be around somewhere!"
"Dost thou agree to my rate?"
"But why am I speaking of this to thee? If thou didst attempt the Test, it would surely kill thee."
"Now thou art playing a joke on me. Thou art broke!"
"Never mind, then!"
"I told thee! It was him!"
"For all I know it could be as simple as lighting a candle! Or perhaps she is referring to the power to trap souls."
"Wouldst thou like something else?"
"Take thy case directly to the MageLord -- he shall aid thee!"
"Well... I suppose not..."
"Standarr had a disagreement with this warrior. I'd wager he could tell thee a tale or two about him!"
"Now I must apologize to Sir Horffe!"
"To provide various magics and items in Terfin."
"To buy something else?"
"Thou dost need a blacksmith to do that. I wager my dad could do it... I mean, could have... if he were still alive..."
"One of my functions is to find gifted children for this school. When they are located, I bring them to the school."
"He planned to destroy the Bears! And the Wolves! And to make himself King of the city!"
The man looks at you through smiling eyes.
"Thou art a fine customer. Please stop by any time."
"Thou dost already possess more skill than I could teach thee!"
"Listen to what she says!"
"Where hath he gone? Bah, I know not. Nor, for that matter, do I care!"
"Then I will continue to keep thy belongings for thee. Thou hast but to return and ask for them again."
"Excellent! Now we can repair thy sword."~ "Place it here and activate it. When the machine is working, use it on the sword."
"I miss having a drink or two with that rogue! Let's go find that knight!"
"I believe that thou hast already heard that one." ~"Wouldst thou like to hear it again?"
"I would be greatly honored, milord!"
"What business dost thou have with me, stranger?"
"I am Syria, a fighter from the south."
"I am Wilfred, Knight of the Bear Command -- formerly of Sleeping Bull Inn."
"Most of the Mundanes born here eventually leave. They settle in Fawn or Monitor, and this is better for them."
"What can I do for thee, dear?"
"They are big mean ugly liontigers! Or is that tigerlions? They are ferocious and they want to eat us!"
"To be my great pleasure. To look forward to the meeting..."
"'Twill not do my reputation any good, but I accept thine offer."
"What I have to show thee should quell any doubts thou mayest yet have."
She thinks a moment.
"I am glad that she is dead, the bitch!"
"Lady Leigh is very skilled as a healer. I have yet to see her lose a patient."
Zorn dips the helmets in water to cool them.
"I doubt that we shall have as many visitors as memorable as thou art come through town for quite a while!"
"Perhaps at a later time."
"In life, we were victims of the Soldiers of Order. I was burned alive."
"Stay and listen to our words, for we are performing a great Ode in honor of the Serpent of Chaos. He shall hear and reward us."
"What of our bargain? I had expected better of thee..."
"I am the teller at the Mint. I am also a member of the Britannian Tax Council."
"I would rather belong to the Bear Command than accept such an offer!"
"So be it. Perhaps thou wilt enjoy a riddle later."
"The last time any of us saw Number 7, I was with Number 2... And that was some time ago."
"I am too young to have a job. I just help my mother on the farm."
"There are those who believe that Erstam is Pothos' father. But Pothos will never talk about it, so I do not know."
"Iieeeee.... Help me, Avatar! Help me! I can't escape... It will catch me and devour me!" *"Heelllp!"
"I offer thee one of my spells in exchange for the stockings. If thou dost accept, then give them to me."
"By the way, hast thou had a demonstration of my training technique?"
"Listen to his tales -- I think that he is attracted to thee, Shazzana."
"Strange name, isn't it? 'Tis actually Flindo's shop, but he's away so much that Bucia runs it."
"I fear that someone hath destroyed Number 7, the keeper of the key!"
"There are unseen energies which permeate the worlds. A monk within the Order of Xenka seeks to attune himself with these ethereal vapors."
"I was holding the door open for one of the crew who was running for shelter when one of those storms hit."
"Come back when thou art hungry and we shall serve thee then."
"Then the outcome of the trial would not change, say, if I moved those prayer levers...?"
"Dost thou care for something else?"
"I can give thee 300 guilders for any piece of jewelry thou hast."
"the Rangers must always be consulted in criminal matters."
"To be the town set aside for us gargoyles who wish to reside in our own culture."
"'Tis thine!"
"Perhaps thou shouldst inspect thine equipment as well! I shall make a list of what we have."
"If thou wouldst bring me the sword, I could examine it for thee."
"I think ye missed somethin' ye might find real helpful-like."
"Rubbish! 'Tis long gone, and I am an old woman now."
"So, thou and she are teaming against me, aye? Spreading lies and rumors? Poisoning my reputation?"
You watch in stunned horror as Bollux pierces his chest open with his fingers.
"I will 'loan' thou this key for say... 40 guilders? Is it worth that much to adventure in the catacombs?"
"I am unable to speak further -- I am incapable of expressing all that Xenka is and was."
"The crystal that Edrin wears is a shard of the Dream Crystal. That is how I was able to speak with him."
Day 32: Uneventful except for repairs from last night's storm.
"Soon I had patients on three islands. It was then that Lord British received word of my practice."
"I will not discuss matters with a stranger to Monitor. Thou shouldst speak with Lord Marsten."
"'til it sank."
"I have no love for Balance, but I also know that Chaos cannot reign in Imbalance..."
"Thou dost walk with honor,~"I know thou wilt not tell,~"Of dignity's stains I do not bother,~"My concerns are none save for Nell."
"It is getting late! I have truly enjoyed our talk, but I think I shall eat my dinner now."
"Aye, mother. And thou wilt tell all who will listen! Do not harass what few customers we do have..."
"Well, these are mysterious times. Strange occurrences have become usual..."
"Bucia is the proprietor of the Capessi Canton in the bazaar. She is Moonshade's only provisioner."
"I do not give my merchandise away! Thou dost not have the guilders to purchase this!"
"Thine arms. Thy legs. Thy fists. This is what makes 'boxing'."
"Excellent. To which altar do you wish to donate?"
"Thou art as full of questions as a novice!"
"Except for Nastassia."
"Thou art correct!"
"That item resembles one of my laboratory apparati -- but I don't recall that anything is missing..."
"I found her pitiful body dumped in the street, with her insides... twisted... torn out..."
"I am honored to meet thee. I have always valued the brave Pikemen that guard our roads."
"I sell wedges for 2 gold each. Still interested?"
"I am ready to aid thee. Thou couldst have chosen no better companion than myself!"
Your conscience rests easy, knowing that you resisted the temptation to carry tales.
"I miss Gwenno so much, Avatar. I hope that it is not long before we find her and I may hold her in mine arms again."
"Alas, Templar's skill could not help young Flessar on the dueling field."
"Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Selina. And I have heard that thou art in need of... finances, shall we say."
"For those who wish to hear of a lost civilization, I can tell thee of the people who left the ruins on this continent."
"Why hast thou brought me before the Oracle, Avatar? Ask me thy questions."
"If I had given up, how would I have been able to help thee?"
You see a wingless gargoyle with a terrible skin disease. It looks as if his face is falling off in patches.
"I am Russell, a shipwright."
"If thou art truly searching for my father's killer, then I will tell thee what I have learned."
"Perhaps another time, then."
"Aha! Not as brave as I thought!"
"Without my precious comb, all of my beauty hath long faded."
"What form of protection wouldst thou like to buy?"
"So! Thou hast discovered me!"
"Consider the Void to be the frame within which our Cosmos is bound. It is the source of unimagined power..."
"I am sure that Batlin brought them expressly to steal the old jawbone left to me by my mentor."
"Here is thy key."
"Vasel, thou art a fool! I will not tolerate thee giving away my precious secrets! Stop it at once!"
"Any infant with potential is taken in the dead of night, and a white stone is left in its place."
You see a man whose long hours of difficult, smouldering work have frozen his face into a rigid expression with eyes like hot coals.
"The Ophidians based all their beliefs on six virtues. And the consequences of an imbalance of these virtues are very dire..."
"Thou dost not yet comprehend how much thy life could be improved through the guidance of The Fellowship."
"Oh, no! Thou shalt not have her name to drag through the mud alongside Ensorcio! Never!"
"Jorvin, if that man speaks another word, blast him with thy wand!"
"I can be found there everyday, from dawn until late in the afternoon."
"I must retreat to the safety of the Sleeping Bull. Do not worry -- we shall meet again, Avatar!"
"To have not have enough gold for that!"
"Thou hast the Cube! Thou cannot use it against -me-!"
"Thou dost want to join me in the Community Room?"
"I remember the piece, not the man. Wasn't a Mage. Not worth recalling, I imagine."
I scratch on this lid.
"Dost thou not see the irony? Only I, the ugliest of all, yet remain to dwell in Fawn!"
"Take care with that blade. 'Tis sharp."
"There thou art! I knew thou wert here somewhere!"
"He is a cute one! And so well-mannered!"
"Yes, begged. But they would not explain, and I was certain they were hiding something from me..."
"Yes, I believe that was her name..."
"He will not let thee into the dungeon until thou dost give him the password. Only Lord Marsten can give the password to thee."
Some sort of vase, with soot inside.
"Since thou dost not have enough room for this last item, it shall go at thy feet."
"Thou always didst lack a backbone, Jendon! Go ta Temple and soothe thy nerves with the Oracle's empty mouthings!"
"Thou must be a stranger..."
"Perhaps he thought that thou didst have some magic with which to counter his cruelty."
"To keep the Goblet, Hero From Another World. To hope that it might have powers to aid you on your quest."
"Budo's also carries a variety of useful things for thy convenience."
"Ask thou Delin if he hath seen a cap like this. He is the provisioner. He should know."
"I am Jakher, named after a great general from the ancient times of Sosaria. Welcome to Minoc."
"Just go to the dining room at breakfast or supper time and mine husband Bennie will serve thee!"
"Yield to me, and perhaps I shall spare thy life! Dost thou yield?"
"Ask Jorvin if it is a Goblin skull. If it is, I might buy it from thee to hang above the door!"
"It is said that this forest lies beyond the swamp, but we have precious little contact with the people there."
"Now it is the center of corruption in all of Britannia. The pirates are all controlled by The Fellowship."
"Our town is a major center of trade in Britannia, and it is a place of social change."
"Wouldst thou like something else?"
"Avatar! Thou shouldst see the treasure that I have found! Stay and finish the Game. I shall try to bring some to thee..."
"I am sorry, good Mage. Thou art quite right."
"Come and see the freak show, Avatar!"
"How many wouldst thou like?"
"Hello! How art thou, my friend?"
"I am a barmaid. I do most of the work at The Bunk and Stool here in Jhelom."
"Troublesome are the times that force me to agree to such bargains!"
"Thou canst find him at the Crematorium, mourning for the dead. Follow the road north."
He hands you the helmet.
"As is customary, our meetings are at 9 p.m. Please feel free to join us."
"Anyway, after that was found there, the mines were sealed. Until Filbercio became MageLord, that is."
"My name is Owings," he says giving you a rapid up and down handshake. "Pleased to meet thee."
"Very well. Thou shalt remain in prison until we see fit to release thee."
"Well, well, well... If it isn't the Avatar!" *"Fool! Thou didst think me dead... But now it is time for thee to die!"
"I have been told to say the following..."
"Begone with thee, stranger. No one who hath not passed the Test of Knighthood is worthy of my time."
"Thou shouldst not jest with me. Simply because I'm only a Mundane doth not mean that thou canst waste my time."
"And what, pray tell, is the intended target of thy immense and most puissant wrath, O' Master of Infinite Destruction?"
"As for Voldin's death -- that saves me the trouble of having him executed. Praise the deed!"
"How many forces, when combined, form the Principles of Balance?"
"We must stay awake..."
"A splendid example of The Fellowship turning someone's life around. Presently he resides in our shelter."
"Wouldst thou help me find Brom?"
"But we were defeated, here..."
"Yes, I do consider myself to be a more than passable judge of character. And dost thou know how I became so?"
"I not see her in long time! I miss her lot."
You see a scrawny and timid-looking man who eyes you fearfully.
"He is the undertaker who lives just north of the Brotherhood."
"How many wouldst thou like?"
"In other words, it looked like it might eat me!"
"Honey will be given by you to me?"
They want the Teeth, I am certain of it! I shall have to take up residence on some isle, where they cannot find me...
"To have many interesting stories about our race. To be writing them down for future generations."
"No! It cannot be true! She cannot be dead! I refuse to believe it!"
"Rocco is the innkeeper at the Blue Boar."
"I swear by The Fellowship I have already told thee all I know concerning the murders!"
"I wish thee luck in thy journeys, Champion of Balance. I am sure that thy road will be long..."
"Thou hast been beaten by my blade. Remember this day, and learn."
"No," he says, watching you closely, "of course he is not."
"To be fighting the dreaming. To regret that there is no aid to give as long as the Imbalance exists!"
"Thou shalt yet need that artifact in thy journeys."
He falls silent here and you notice that the old man's eyes are milky white.
"That is the City of Mages, to the east on the Isle of Beyond. It is a depraved, indulgent, undisciplined place."
"There was a woman here a while ago who spent much time in the Hall of Monitor, examining our museum display. Very friendly."
"He hath taken the chaos of our library and turned it into a vastly more organized area."
"People are killing each other over a difference in philosophies! And thou art parading about as if no one wouldst make thee a target!"
"Lydia was so happy when her sister visited last month, after all these years. The two were inseparable."
"Why would the Guardian go to such lengths, Avatar? He already has thee trapped here... In a land he says will soon rend its heart out."
"This puts me in mind of a story. Wouldst thou like to hear it?"
"Rocco would never have been out-bargained so!"
"Thou must think me witless!"
"All I know is that his spells are old. Not anything created by these Mages."
"This is my grandfather! Thou hast reunited the souls of my family!"
"The very existence of Freedom silences most of the MageLord's detractors."
"Let me see if I understand thee correctly. Thou wishest me to accompany thee to an ancient temple."
"There be one who knows what's what. He knows what be wrong with this town! Gargoyles! That is what be wrong. He hates 'em, 'e does."
"What? What? Oh, 'tis thee again."
"Xenka was a cross farm-wife who saw her visions as a means to have others do her work for her."
"Christopher had expressed interest in leaving The Fellowship. Perhaps he had stored it for safekeeping."
"Alyssand, beware! The Oracle is the instrument of divine Truth, and it shall not be mocked!"
"'Tis best not to try and second guess Shamino the Anarch. His definition of a transgression changes from moment to moment..."
"Perhaps thou shouldst inquire at the Winery. Ernesto is most knowledgeable about wines."
"I don't have to answer thy questions, traitor!"
"What dost thou say to this?"
"Since it is such a crossroads, thou canst often meet all sorts of interesting folk there. And it is the direct link to the City of Mages."
"I have hope for only one thing, Captain. And that dwells deep within mine heart, as Delphynia knows..."
"What wouldst thou like to buy?"
"I have not seen our liege in many years."
"'Tis a sacred item once belonging to the Goblins. It was what gave their ancient leader, Gurnordir, the power to build the Goblin Horde."
"I care not what thou didst find in the woods. 'Tis probably Goblin loot."
"Now is not the time, but the tides will soon be in -- precisely when, I cannot predict."
"Rather showy, if thou shouldst ask me... But rather spectacular results. Entirely too random for my tastes, however."
"Help me, Please! I beseech thee... It is he who is evil, not I." *"I cannot survive much more of this torture..."
"Now then, why hast thou come to my domain?"
"Here is thy key for this inn. 'Twill only work once."
"No one outside of our town cares for it at all."
"The lot hereabouts weren't much good. The Goblins killed 'em."
"I can give thee 600 guilders for every gold bar thou hast."
"I will sell thee some food when we are open!"
"Ask thou Delin if he hath heard of such a cap. He is the provisioner. He should know."
"Did anyone see that color? To be honest, I did not. The flash near blinded me!"
"There are several... more books lying about the house. I do not... know what they are about. Adjhar read them."
"Dost thou have the book entitled, `The Stone of Castambre?'"
"Ask me again if thou dost change thy mind."
"My name is Amanda."
"If thou dost ever become a Knight of Monitor, then pray that the Ashes of Gurnordir proclaim thee a Knight of the Bears!"
"Thou shouldst do well not to waste my time so in the future! I am an important man!"
"I wonder where Batlin could be! 'Tis not like him to miss a meeting."
"The MageLord? Oh, how canst thou think of him when the two of us are here together, becoming intimate..."
"They mainly populate the east part o' the Great Forest, way on the other side."
"I charge a small amount of the money exchanged. Dost thou accept?"
"Each one of us makes of life what we can, whether by fate or the treachery of others. Dost thou see me judging ye?"
"'Tis done!"
"I can give thee 20 gold coins for every 1 gold nugget thou hast."
"Thou shouldst really return thy medallion to the person from whom it came. Only Fellowship members are permitted to wear them."
"What shall we speak of, then?"
"I know that Lydia must have given thee this tattoo, yet I find it difficult to believe she would poison a stranger."
"Stand back while I crank the winch. 'Tis heavy and dangerous. Thou dost never know when it might come down upon thine head."
"Well, I seem to have misplaced thy belongings. Mine apologies. As a favor to thee, I shall let thee keep what thou dost have right now."
"Leave me to die in peace! I have nothing left... nothing..."
"Moonshade is in many ways a perfect city, a perfect example of civilization with that highest form of government -- a Magocracy."
"Greetings young man. How comes one so young into such company?"
"The rats are my friends. Dost thou not like my companions?"
You find yourself unable to respond, and your muscles are clenching as if to lash out with the wicked blade in your hand.
"Mmm. Mama! Me Papa. She Mama. We make zug-zug. Maybe someday make Boy or Girl!"
"Oh, darling! Meet me in my bedroom..."
"I make all the apparatus for the Mages. All different. Every Mage wants something a little different than the next."
"But if the piece is heated or cooled too quickly, it becomes brittle and fragile. 'Tis a very exacting task."
"Most excellent! We shall be to work immediately, and hope to have information very soon. Please return in a few hours."
"I shall certainly be sad to part with it, but if thou dost claim it, then I must give it to thee."
"All right, I suppose thou hast learned thy lesson. I shall rejoin."
"I shall study this evidence, and if thou art right, I will bring it before the other Lords."
"Iolo! My beloved Iolo!"
"I shall never make a profit with customers like thee..."
"What dost thou take me for!"
"Then get out of my sight! I do not wish to speak with thee!"
"Very good! Let me see how many thou dost have..."
"The trees are cut by a human with a shiny, sharp item."
"Why, if I accepted such a price, I would have to close my shop and move away!"
"What a buffoon! He thinks every woman in this town wants him, but I find him repulsive!"
The ape-like creature slowly and cautiously walks up to you. He, or she, sniffs for a moment, and then points to the honey you are carrying.
"Zounds, man! In the earshot of Lady Yelinda? Hast thou no decency!"
"From the depths of some hell, she hath summoned up a tireless warrior to pursue me!"
"I am and always will be the one called Adjhar."
"In its place is a strange building, locked tight and reportedly filled with hideous monsters and great treasure!"
"Filbercio is a man of great passions. The Mountains of Freedom are a powerful argument against crossing him in any way."
"Let every person be rewarded according to their merits and Trust and Unity will follow naturally."
"Then ye be out of luck, matey."
"Hast thou decided if thou wilt help me?"
"Thy friend hath been spared, stranger. Go thy way... I must attend to the wishes of my masters."
"This is my workshop. I peruse my books and papers here. Occasionally, I invent things, such as this crystal ball."
"I can give thee 2 gold coins for every 1 monetari thou hast."
"Hah, I have bested thee. Away with thee!"
"He doth refuse to have any dealings with Moonshade to this day. He sits on his island trying to find a way to create life."
"My partner's name is Malloy."
"Thou hast a lot of gall attempting to buy something from my shop without enough gold in thy possession!"
"His name is Morghrim. His face is horribly scarred, yet I do not fear him the way I fear Draygan."
"Whee! Dia-per!"
"Hmmm. Thou dost have a certain quality... hast thou ever acted on stage?"
"While the Great One yet slumbers, the Chaos Serpent hath the power to prevail over Order. I will have faith, unlike these others."
"Oh, I wandered about a bit as a lad, but I never went too far. Never wanted ta lose myself..."
"If thou dost think of anything, let me know!"
"Since when is this a crime? What doth the lady say?"
"Thou canst not take me to the dungeons without a fight!"
You see a large cyclops. It looks at you and blinks its eye in irritation.
Shanda becomes excited and snorts as if he were saying several sentences.
"Thou must have Caine's assistance in creating the formula, but I can give thee the ingredients."
"Greetings to thee!"
"That is all I know."
"It is rare to find one who trades as well as thee..."
Fenn hangs his head low.
"So Garritt admits he stole the venom vial. I cannot believe it! I do not know what to say."
"Perhaps later."
"Hmpf! Thou dost not have that much gold! Thou art almost as poor as I!"
"For those who would hear a tale of bitter bravery, I can tell thee of the lost king."
"Saralek is my bonded-one. `Wife' is what you would call her. My home is her home."
"Thy powers have dwindled due to thine imprisonment. Thou art no match for me, now..."
"No forgiveness necessary. I thank thee for performing thy duty."
"Thou shouldst ask Andrio -- I am certain that he could help thee! He is very bright."
"She is a very private person. Works at The Baths. I have not spoken three words to her in my life."
"Didst thou speak with Lydia?"
You see your former companion and friend, Geoffrey, Captain of the Guard.
"For all I know, Xenka is talking about herself!"
You see an elderly man struggling to maintain a regal posture.
"The Sands of Time are dwindling! We must hurry!"
"We shall now begin the process. This will hurt, but as a warrior, thou art accustomed to suffering."
"What did the strangers ask of thee, Alyssand? There was a particular item..."
"Art thou a follower of this Fellowship, Scots?"
"Thou dost not have 30 Monetari! Art thou trying to swindle me! Bah!"
Resting an axe on his shoulder, a tall, broad-chested man smiles and nods at you.
"Then I can be of no use to thee."
"One was a dark-skinned fighter, very strong but seemingly lacking in wit."
"Lies! Lies! Simplistic half truths meant to snare the unwitting and twist Beauty's truth!"
"Forgive me if I do not believe thee."
"If events should change thy mind, contact me."
"To want to know about the organization or the tenets?"
"Fine. If thou dost wish to be the Avatar, I will not argue. Thou canst be the Avatar if thou dost want to be."
"Besides the Tower here, there is a second at Sleeping Bull. The third Tower was near Fawn, and hath been overrun by Goblins."
"Doth not sound like Fawn ale... Maybe that weak vintage from Moonshade. I do not sell it here -- Fawn folk prefer Fawn ale!"
"None can say if they are intelligent." ~"They build no structures and speak no recognizable language."
"To want something else?"
"Dost thou wish to buy some spells?"
"'Tis a bear's skull. Bears are common in this area and to the south of here as well."
"Thou shouldst bring this matter to the attention of the Rangers. Julia would not let such an injustice stand, I am sure of it."
"That is good, for what I have to show thee would befuddle the minds of most of this town's inhabitants."
"Thou art a fine customer... Return any time!"
"To weep for the creatures that succumb most easily to the sickness of this world."
"I haven't heard tell of one that size since the last time we sailed around that big forest north of here. They were all over there."
"What spell wouldst thou like to buy?"
The other Fellowship members cheer with pleasure.
"Thou art already as proficient as I! I am afraid that thou cannot be trained further in this."
"Later on, seek that which cannot be seen. It may be hard to find."
"Thy loss, then."
"In this one thing, at least, I can fulfill mine obligation."
"Please come to see me whenever thou art in Moonshade again."
"Very well, I shall bare my soul to thee."
"Avatar! I am glad to see thee!"
"Thou dost not have enough gold for that!"
"The damage hath been done. It is now thine to keep."
"That is correct, Vasel! Thou shouldst be returning to thine appointed chores!"
"I would be more than happy to sell thee a jug of milk, but for now the dairy is closed."
"Thou dost not have enough gold for that!"
"I am sorry to say we are on our break. Please return to the stage area during normal hours."
"I must be losing my mind to agree to such a price!"
"If everyone strives to be worthy of that which they seek, such injustices would be few."
"I do not care for this talk of traitors. Who would betray us to the Goblins? No man could be that insane."
"What dost thou care to exchange for monetari?"
"They can be... very... persuasive."
"'Thou wert strong, thou wilt be stronger. Thy strength will be exalted in truth.'"
"Fool! Thou hast no idea what thou hast lost..."
"All is in an uproar, with Rotoluncia dead and her replacement -- the Necromancer Mortegro -- missing."
"Who would have thought I would lose my mind so young! To accept such a price..."
"To exit this place, thou must remember that from death a dreamer awakes. Seek the pillar of flame."
"They shall be carving that name on thy tombstone if thou dost not return to work!"
"The meaning of `job' is not understood."
"Follow me through the gate, Avatar! Thou wilt soon be home..."
"I have not seen them in quite some time."
"I am the most powerful wizard in this city, and I could teach thee many things -- if thou wert not a mere Mundane."
"I am Ruggs, a poor sailor exiled from Britannia and from Fawn. How may I serve thee today?"
"Thou art not a Knight. Only warriors are welcome here. Move along before thou dost feel the cold steel of mine halberd."
The Mayor looks you up and down, not sure if he believes Iolo or not. He looks at Iolo skeptically.
"Wilfred is a Knight of Monitor, but his home is at the inn of the Sleeping Bull."
"Apparently the buttons also control the doors to the private chambers."
"I am sorry, but thou cannot possibly carry that much weight!"
"About whom dost thou wish to know?"
"My dear, calm thyself. Perhaps our visitor shall tell us all, without the use of force..."
"I am a teacher in Minoc, along with Jakher."
"Thou dost not have enough money for that..."
"Oh, I surrender!"
"Well, I don't know how to kill him. I only know that he is very, very tough. Mayhap immortal."
"Tag! Playing tag!"
"If thou wilt bring me the item, I shall examine it for thee. I can tell thee nothing now."
"Seek thou Alyssand. She makes stockings. She might be able to help thee."
"'Tis a small wonder that I did not end there..."
Plate armour offers solid protection for thy money. I would recommend a pair of plate leggings as well.
"I am Siranush. I have been expecting thee..."
"Batlin... ah, I remember he came here asking about some sort of rock sculpture or something. Black rock..."
"I am flattered by the suspicions, but alas... I am innocent in this case."
"One day we kill all Men. Today we kill thee. Ha! Then eat thee for supper! Mmm... Tasty!"
"To have not enough gold for that!"
"Why would a man who hath cheated death not drink, Avatar? Perhaps I should have died with my brothers..."
"She is a nearly blind elderly woman who runs the antique shoppe on the east side of the river."
"As I told thee, my name is Forsythe."
"My sincerest wish is that he rot slowly in Filbercio's mountain prison."
"Good luck. Neyobi's life depend on it."
"Monitor hath no King or Queen -- we do not believe in such things, and left our ancient homeland to escape a tyrant who thought otherwise."
"Oh! Thou must return later when thou hast enough room in thy pack for these markers."
"Hast thou forgotten? Why, I am Caladin!"
"So sayest thou, Olon. I think Alyssand's story qualifies well enough."
When a man finds no peace within himself, 'tis useless to seek it elsewhere...
"Why dost thou wait? Use the arrow! Use it to strike down the tyrant Draygan!"
"I am afraid that I'm very busy right now. Perhaps we could talk about this later."
"Not being from Monitor, I am afraid I am woefully uninformed..."
"Thou art correct -- these prices are entirely too high!"
"Aye. My brother says that he was told we can find safe passage aboard a ship here. But all we've seen is Captain Hawk."
"I charge 30 monetari, and no less, to perform mine healing. Is this acceptable?"
"There, 'tis done. Thine infection hath been healed."
"Ducio is the Master Artisan, capable of forging or repairing all manner of magical apparatus."
"Oi already told ye that's m'job."
"We need not these blankets..."
"Thou art not worthy of thy Knighthood..."
"Oh. Never mind, then."
"Thou dost not have enough experience. Come back when thou art more knowledgeable of the world!"
"Hello, my name is Xanthia."
"Thou art addressing Nicodemus."
"If thou wishest to..."
"There was a portly mage named Batlin and a lovely lady named Gwenno."
"I flew between the Serpent Pillars to reach this place. I suspect that is how thou didst come here thyself."
Now my bones decompose.
"Thou dost know that it is a crime to possess Stoneheart! It drives men into lunacy!"
"How many different types of Reagents doth Erstam write about?"
"We shall not profit this way..."
"There's this island... Can't at all remember where it is. No one lives there, though. A barren, uninviting place..."
"And ye are?"
"He may be a Bear, but he doth act like a pig! Ha!"
"We guard the Caddellite, do we not? Our purpose in life is to guard the Caddellite!"
"Thou dost not have 30 monetari! Talk to me again when thou canst pay me!"
"Flame? Oh, yes, we keep the fires going constantly."
"To apologize, but I must charge that amount!"
"Oh, was that strange armour that appeared in my bedchamber thine?"
"To be an excellent choice. To meditate at the shrine for you for a donation of 5 gold. To be willing to donate 5 gold?"
"To tell you to seek out Draxinusom, human, or Forbrak. To have much information about Terfin."
"Why do I drink so much? That's rather a personal question..."
"They were led by the Master of Ethicality, and his magic wrecked the Temple. My parents were slain, and my brother taken prisoner."
"In order to become one with the soil, I have been granted the task of nurturing the crops."
"There is a traveller visiting from Yew. He has seen many exciting things in Britannia. I enjoy listening to his many tales of adventure."
His dog seemed to be meditating as well.
"Some other time, then."
"Avatar! Please free thine old friend! Now that Marsten is jailed, please speak to Brendann and win my freedom!"
You see a man leaning on a longbow.
"Why, I run the Provisioner's Shop here in Britain. A second home to the intrepid, it is."
"Thou mayest call me Sir Pendaran."
"Of course, I never doubted that thou wouldst return..."
"By my sore eyes! 'Tis a comely wench wit' a tattoo... like any good sailor! Me name's Olon, and I'm a fisherman by trade."
"She is the ruler of Fawn and all its environs. All who honor Beauty honor Yelinda."
"Now that thou hast bested me on the field of battle, I am thy friend. What can I do for thee?"
"Hello, I am Andrio. I never meet outsiders. Couldst thou tell me all about thy travels and adventures?"
He pulls forth a heart-shape stone and, with a final flurry of action, drops the stone upon Adjhar's chest as he falls dead to the ground.
"Thou vilt soon be enlightened about their true nature."
"Puny Avatar! Thou canst not defeat what is undefeatable!"
"Some other time then."
"Well, now. Just how didst thou come to this island? That is right. -That- ferryman. He is on the ferry of Skara Brae, to the southeast."
"How many wouldst thou like?"
"I do not own one. The only people that do are Elizabeth and Abraham, Batlin, and Hook himself. Hook probably keeps his key in his abode."
"Very well, then!"
"Never once did they offer to try and cure my supposed madness, for we were too poor to pay their fees."
Slowly, as if with great effort, it raises it head.
BRITANNIAN MINING COMPANY ~~ ~~log.
"But alas, I am spoken for! The sorceress Frigidazzi is my current love, and she allows me no trespasses."
"Wouldst thou like something else?"
"Thou cannot possibly carry all that gold. Thou must come back when I can give thee the proper amount of gold!"
"A pleasure to meet thee, I am certain. But I have no patience for idle tongue wagging."
"I am forbidden to discuss this subject with thee!"
"Thou art not the first to be attracted to our facilities! In recent days, two visitors are memorable."
"To say that the Hero is a Man, most like you."
"And now she hath returned! The Seer hath come back from beyond the Void."
"Oh, I see. Carry on, carry on."
"Thou canst find him at the camp outside the city gates."
"Come back again when thou art hungry and I am sure thou shalt change thy mind."
"When Argus heard Flessar repeating these things, Argus called him into a selfish duel and killed him!"
"And let me remind thee that we give service with a smile around here. 'Tis why the Blue Boar Inn is famous throughout these parts."
"To accept!"
"What! Thou hast not heard of me?"
"Let me think... ah, that will be 300 filari."
"Thou art a brave Avatar! Dost thou wish to hear another?"
"This dark sorcerer will trouble thee no more..."
"We make the finest wine that thou wilt find anywhere. Wouldst thou care to try some?"
"Dost thou know what The Fellowship is?"
"I work with Mara and a gargoyle named Lap-Lem."
"Paws is a town where thou mayest feel the icy grip of poverty about thine heart."
"My mother died a long time ago. I can just barely remember her."
"He could not have been Goblin, for they never walk in the woods alone. Therefore... I think he must have been the Monitorian traitor!"
"Yes, I sell milk and cheese. Thou mayest find the dairy between Camille's farm and the slaughterhouse."
"I am sorry, but I do not have time for this. My studies devour mine entire day."
"But he doth work hard... when I yell at him. Shows promise."
"The Fellowship."
"I have no time for this!"
"They called me that when I was young. But looking back on it, I think they meant it in a complimentary way."
"Forgive me. I have no questions for thee."
"Art thou a Fellowship member?"
"Yurel does not care. Yurel breaths. Yurel fears. Yurel loves. That makes Yurel the same as others, though Yurel wears fur or not."
"I feel tired, but I am all right! My mind was full of awful dreams. Thou hast saved me! I shall remember thee always!"
"I am trapped! Help me!"
"About the usual sorts of things -- the weather, the goblin threat, and so forth?"
"Art thou the great hero from a distant land?! Oh, my name is Freli. I am glad to meet thee!"
"Thou art carrying too much to take thy book."
"Yes, yes?" Raymundo snaps. "What dost thou want? I'm busy!"
"A man named Falcon declared himself the leader of a group of dissenters that was comprised of nearly half of our number."
"But alas, my duty as a Knight keeps me here in Monitor. The Goblins are a constant threat."
"Press first the middle button, and then the top button. Press the south button last and thou shalt be free."
Prepared by Shamino.
"Perhaps I can find another way to escape before I starve to death."
"My spells are not for sale, not to the likes of such as thyself. But assume not that all my powers have left me, for some still remain."
"He looks to be too old for my daughter, now that I see him clearly."
"Ah, yes, Iolo, Shamino, and Dupre."
"...thou had best watch thy step, lest he ensorcel thee with a love spell!"
"Ever since Filbercio made it a prison, no one hath come out of there again!"
"The original branch is in Britain. But I do fine business here in the Hold."
He turns back to you and grins.
"Avatar, this stranger grows upon me by the moment. Surely he would be a boon travelling companion."
"We need thee. The Cause needs thee!"
"To wonder why you bother me so!"
"To charge more next time. To have sold to you too cheaply!"
"And I can do little more than keep Rabindrinath's insanity from destroying us."
"'Tis in the western end of the castle."
This is an invitation for thee and thy friends to dine at the MageLord's Palace.
"I know not what a farm wife would consider great magic!"
"So maybe I should keep my own counsel, but I'm not the quiet type. The Fawn Tower was betrayed!"
"For instance, thou couldst perchance assemble a near- complete set of the fabled Serpent Teeth -- "
"I am Pothos, the Apothecary in this city."
"Lord Marsten sometimes authorizes me to give additional tattoos, but only when the recipient hath earned them through Courage or Valor."
"I do not know anything about them. I never took one. Maybe thou shouldst ask the man at the Fellowship Branch. Klog."
"Thou hast not rid us of the evil Liche yet. Fulfill this quest as thou hast agreed and I shall give thee the answers thou dost seek."
"Very well. If thou didst not get the first two there is no good reason for me to continue now."
"I shall now tell thee the way to restore the Serpent of Chaos. Until thou dost do this, Balance cannot be restored."
"One by one they fell... And there was nothing I could do! My pleas to the heavens were in vain!"
"If thou sayest a word about this price to anyone, I will deny it!"
"Thank thee very much! Now, goodbye!"
"A simply wretched little urchin. Always sulking. But then, one must realize that he has no father to discipline him properly."
"As to the method of how it works -- Thou hast proven thyself intelligent. Discern it for thyself."
"Welcome to Fawn, city of Beauty. My name is Zulith. I am the Chancellor. It is mine honor and duty to serve thee."
"They were the crew of that ship that sailed from the other side of the world -- said something about Serpent Pillars in the ocean."
"I doubt that he doth have any Serpent Teeth left to steal, so thou wilt have to make do with something else I suspect."
"It doth cause me to wonder why anyone in the city of Mages would buy the rough stockings I make, when they could purchase ones so soft."
"But Avatar, surely thou dost not know the password! How canst thou fool this infernal thing?"
"Then I can tell thee nothing. But if thou hast stolen this from me, I shall not pay ransom for it!"
"But thou didst not have to give me anything to prove thy love. That thou art here now is proof enough."
"I can escape thee! My powers dwarf thine..."
"To need more gold than you have. To need 50 gold."
"Thou wouldst be a poor Knight without the Mark. Seek out Lydia, for she will give thee the Tattoo of Knighthood."
"Wouldst thou like to join?"
Trent paces around the burned-out remains of his shop. When he sees you return, he rushes forward, looking for his love, Rowena.
"Father, thou WILT stay indoors when those storms come through town!"
"With great pride!"
"I spin tales and sing songs!"
"That is patently untrue."
"Let us take that torch! We need all that we can find, for they do not burn for long."
"In all of Britannia thou shalt not find a place that changes so little. Even the people always seem the same."
"I am trapped within this wall. My soul hath occupied this place for many, many years."
"I am Brendann, stranger."
"I hope thou art progressing on the murder investigation."
"I can give thee 1 monetari for every 2 gold coins thou hast."
"To have seen the Three Ghosts stalking the land, through the Dream."
"It is my choice in arms. The spear combines the best of both range and power. It is the perfect hunting weapon."
"Ha! Excellent! Go then! Bring me the ring! Do not betray me or I shall sate myself by killing thee slowly!"
"Which coin dost thou care to exchange for guilders?"
"When thou hast become a Knight, I can be of service to thee. Until then, go thy way."
"The Beast did conquer all of Sosaria, and did force the Fawnese to flee into the sea. How cruel!"
"I will accept this price." ~"I can always use the extra funds for research."
"He frightens me. Look into those cold, hard eyes! Aren't those the eyes of a murderer?"
"Please leave if thou canst not pay."
"Up or down?"
"What wouldst thou like to buy?"
"That I know. My name is Rudyom."
"He stays home to care for their son."
"Our city is ruled by Shamino the Anarch, a most powerful wizard."
"Whoa! Hey everyone! This here is the Avatar!"
"If thou art ever in need, come to me. I shall give thee anything I possess. Thou dost see, I have a good heart."
"My name is Klog."
"It was so terrible! Everyone is dead, and the city is destroyed..."
"Poetry, astronomical observations, tide charts, and maps... Everything that might provide some insight into the meaning of the prophecies."
"To have been very poor visibility, but to be positive I was scuffling with an armed knight."
"Well, I -did- think he was going to give it to me to make up for all the times I have caught him wenching and carousing."
"Shhh! Talk to me about it later," he whispers, gesturing subtly towards Balayna, "when she is not around."
"Unholy creatures! We must destroy these foul skeletons, Avatar!"
"To be truthful, the discussion was so distasteful that I quickly put it from my mind."
"With what crime art thou charged?"
"I'm glad thou art returned."
"'Tis not enough. Bring us more!"
"My fee will leave thee with nothing!"
"Well, these people seem to have been here a very long time. They are... lonely... for company."
"Oh dear. Well, I know thou art busy. Some other time, then."
"I cannot seem to recall what his name was. He was not the talkative sort, least not to me."
"Our residents include Alina and her child, and Merrick."
"'Tis a dirty business, this apprenticeship thing. I despise it."
"These look more like something a Mundane would wear. Thou mightest check with Bucia over at the Capessii Canton."
You see a fox standing on his hind legs, staring directly at you.
"One cannot be born a Knight, nor can the title be bestowed for money or influence. Only a worthy warrior can become a Knight."
"I cannot wait."
"Oh, my, thou art too encumbered to take back thy 1000 gold coins! Come back when thine hands are less full!"
"Never again! Never again! I promise! Do not beat me, Master!"
"To have been the clerk of The Fellowship here."
"Welcome back, ol' friend. These're thirsty times, aye?"
"It called itself the pinnacle of earth, until the earthquakes came."
"I am called... Rowena"
"Please, I beseech thee, continue thine hunt!"
"Thou mightest ask Renfry if he hath encountered a body with such an injury lately."
"Thou shouldst mind thy manners, else -- Guide or no -- I'll not aid thee!"
"Might I examine it, please?"
"Enjoy thy meal!"
"Thou and I, we'll do good together!"
"Before thine arrival there had not been a stranger in New Magincia for years, save for the survivors of the shipwreck."
"Adventure is not Trellek's desire."
"And yet... to wonder if you are the Hero of the Dream."
"I can give thee 3 guilders for every 4 filari thou hast."
"They have been fighting for at least a year I think."
"No world exists without influencing another. So all may be destroyed if New Sosaria dies."
"'Tis good news indeed, milady."
"Whom dost thou wish to heal?"
"Perhaps we could speak more of these things another time. Say, perhaps during the business hours of my shop?"
"Isn't it interesting that Blood Moss is so potent, since it is connected with the fluid of life? Blood... But I'm babbling..."
Your old friend Shamino stands before you and you marvel that he has finally progressed into what some might call 'middle age'.
"Simple disobedience, really. Oh, yes, and someone cut Hamlin's throat and stole his gold. I do not know who did it."
"Hi there! What is on thy mind?"
"Yes, Joth, Garth, and Voldin. They are my most trusted advisors... Aside from the Chancellor, of course."
"Then thou knowest that these are words meant to enlighten and guide our lives to Beauty."
"Some other time, then."
"What wouldst thou like to know?"
"Some other time, then."
"Here they are."
"Naturally, now that Isstanar is here, I have become the SubCommander."
"Too dangerous for a coward like thyself? And I thought better of thee..."
"Of course, in the realm of politics as well as the realm of magic what is one today may very well be the other tomorrow!"
"Dost thou wish to buy one of my pelts or cloaks?"
"I am restricted from taking action against any of my fellows, so it is up to thee to determine what hath befallen the keeper of the key."
"'Tis common knowledge, Avatar! I am surprised at thee... Cease such questions and put thine attention to the Game!"
"I already have a wife, thank thee!"
"No?" Csil lowers his voice. "The Fellowship."
"Truly thou art the bravest Monitorian alive!"
"All that was ever retrieved out of those mountains was the ore that was taken out while it was still a mine!"
"The Trapper struck! All Gwani dead but Yenani, Neyobi and I."
"I am bored, 'tis true. But I do not take kindly to wasting my time!"
"Trust me, she is someone thou dost not wish to cross."
"I beg thee to depart..."
"All right, thou canst have him. Here be the key."
"To see first, Draxinusom. To be leader of the city. To know many of the residents."
"Perhaps I could find another song for thee..."
"And then Celennia disappears, just like that! Left Frigidazzi in quite a snit, I'll tell thee!"
"The shelter? 'Tis the large building filled with fawning hypocrites. Thou shouldst have little trouble finding it!"
"Please make up thy mind!"
"Another, eh. Hast thou 5 more gold for me?"
"Perhaps the sight is too common to affect them. I am certain that Fawn males will not be as... unaffected, shall we say."
"Cheated, and by mine own sister, wouldst thou believe it!"
"Thou dost wish to purchase something?"
"I know not what they mean... But none of the mages in Britannia seem to be able to predict the outcome of the most simple spells."
"Indeed, thy friend has departed this life. I will attempt to restore them to this world."
"The wretched beasts! I suppose thou hast heard of the ambush at Fawn Tower. They do not fight fair!"
"I must first prepare the proper materials. Thou shouldst come to my manor after midnight, and we shall then conjure spectres."
"We have a most delectable brew for thee, sweetly flavored with the honey of bees raised in the mountain highlands."
"Wouldst thou like something else?"
"Aha! Then die, Spawn of Chaos!"
"How wouldst thou know, Olon? Thou hast never seen one, I'll wager!"
"Now that thou hast recovered the Helm of Monitor from their fiendish hands, the scales have again tipped in our favor."
"Garth is of little use in all but representing the interests of the merchant captains."
"I am unable to take thy money, for some strange reason."
"It is not the first time I have been accused of being too expensive."
"Ah. To be too bad. To tell you Teregus wanted to know how he was doing."
"Thou art carrying too much, my friend! Unload thyself of some of thy belongings and I will sell thee the deed to this beautiful ship."
"Very kind woman, she was, sir."
"No need to shout. I'm not deaf."
"Too plain for a Mage... But wait, I remember this!"
You see a solemn fellow in healer's robes.
"I will train thee now."
"Some have entered, never to return. Perhaps they are there still... Death is greedy, and holds a fate for those of like intent."
"What spell art thou interested in?"
"Listen, Spektor and I truly have nothing together. Honestly, 'tis nothing."
"Very well..."
"I am Stefano, late of Moonshade, and obtainer of rarities..."
"Return to thy camp."
"The Guide shall make our aim true! The Guide shall lead the way to our truly perfect world!"
"If that is what thou dost want, so be it."
"I made it for a sailor from Fawn. I'll wager that it cost him half a year's wages. He wanted it for an engagement ring."
"Go about thy business, and at the appropriate moment, the MageLord shall summon thee."
"I am not a member, though."
"Since thou dost not have enough room for this last item, I will place it at thy feet."
"As for me, I shall begone! Thou shalt never find me! Farewell, Avatar!"
"To sell magic to others."
You see a troll, sulking in his cell. As he breathes, you can see his ribs protrude out from under his hide.
"Wilt thou agree to my rate?"
"Since thou dost not have enough room for this last item, I will place it at thy feet."
"I can give thee 4 filari for every 1 monetari thou hast."
"Bring me three fresh Mandrake Roots, and I shall let thee have a spellbook. The Roots are found on Monk Isle."
"I will train thee now."
"Ah, Avatar!" ~"This is as it should be... The food is good, the wine is sweet and the company is warm! Wouldst thou care to join me?"
"But beware of the automatons!"
"Lady Yelinda is the ruler of Fawn. Her word is law... Usually delivered by her little shadow, Zulith."
"But I have already sold thee the deed to 'The Nymphet'! I am afraid that was the only ship I had at this time."
"Do I look like I am working now? Leave me alone. Come to the House of Games during normal business hours."
"Why dost thou interrupt my dreaming? Canst thou not see that I have important matters to attend to?" *"Argh! I am waking..."
"Now, even if we wanted to return without Batlin, we cannot venture onto the sea for fear of these terrible storms."
"Thou art truly the Champion of Balance."
"The stockings were evidence, since only Columna wears this sort, and because I found them in Torrissio's manor."
"The Oracle is supposed to speak only the Truth, yet it too often parrots the words of the Priestess and the Great Captains."
"The monk shall come soon, when thou art in a safe place, without strangers or distractions."
"No? What hast thou been doing in my field? Thou art as worthless as most of the workers one finds!"
"Dost thou agree to my rate?"
"In Erstam's book, the section entitled @Other Landmarks@ covers how many areas?"
"Wouldst thou like something else?"
"Since thou dost not have enough room for this last item, I will place it on the ground."
"What! What's happening..."
"But this matter of the spells, it must be discussed in private. Only Mages may hear the secrets which I am about to reveal."
"If she tries anything, Avatar, I shall gladly lop her head off for the effort!"
"The dungeon where would-be knights test themselves. He is a good man for that job."
"Wouldst thou like me to do it?"
"I knew it!"
"Unfortunately, I have a very limited supply of most things right now."
"Dost thou think me a shopkeeper to haggle with? I am Ensorcio the Adept! Do not trifle with me..."
"What dost thou want? I have already enchanted the ring. It can do no more for thee!"
"Very well, Lady Yelinda."
A strange apparatus of glass and copper.
"Excellent! We shall start with a simple riddle."
"Thou canst not handle so much, felon."
"Excellent! First let us enjoy some wine! Wilt thou accept this glass of fine wine?"
"Yes, bellicose, warlike, angry. If thou dost not know that, I believe thou needest to improve thy vocabulary. Thou art too unschooled."
Found some ruins not too far from here.
"Thou art corrcet!"
"Well, there are Cador, Yvella, and Zaksam -- those are the normal ones."
"Don't rant on about the goblins, Olon! Thou canst turn the stomach of a bilge rat when thou dost have a mind to."
"The sword and gem must be in thy hands for the bonding to be accomplished."
"Hmpf! Art thou a fighter? Thou dost not look like a fighter to me!"
"Timmons has come to Jhelom only recently. I can tell thee nothing more of him."
"Do not tell me! Raymundo sent thee to get an Avatar costume! They cost thirty gold coins. Dost thou want one?"
The pirate chews on something in his mouth before replying. "Hi," he finally says.
"Perhaps thou art not truly serious about thy convictions. Mayhaps the princess will take thy line of bets."
"There. 'Tis done!"
"Since thou dost not have enough room for this last item, I will place it at thy feet."
"There is not enough room in your equipment for the contract."
"We are all Knights in this town."
"Scots is not precisely a sailor, I suppose. He is actually a cartographer."
"I must see this. Might I see the evidence?"
"I am not superstitious, mind thee, but I do believe that a man's ashes are sacred. They represent his soul, his heart, his honor."
"Yes, milord."
"So! Thou dost suspect me of kidnapping thy friend!"
"Three of us died in Ice Dragon lair. We two injured. Must return to village in shame."
"Then thy thirst must be quenched by well water, I'm afraid."
"Hast thou properly searched the stables?"
"The Mages of this place are not friendly toward outsiders, but thy survival shall surely impress them."
"There was a heap of bodies where Astrid had last been fighting, but her body was not there. It is obvious to me that they took her alive."
"They have set up camp southeast of town. Near the sawmill. That is suspicious, dost thou not think?"
"But thou wilt never see a ship like this one anywhere in the world! Too bad!"
"Scoundrel! When thou art asked thy name, thou shouldst respond politely and accurately! The Avatar has just asked thee for -thy- name."
"Thou knowest thy weapons well."
"I am able to heal, cure poison, and resurrect. Art thou in need of one of these services?"
"Leave him alone, Luther."
"None shall seek the fountain to meditate again!"
"The last time I heard -that- one I fell off a prehistoric creature from Eodon!"
"Astelleron made us. He is our master."
"Besides, the matter at Knight's Test smacks of wizardry. I think thou hast an unknown enemy from among the Mages of Moonshade!"
"Yet I believe that we somehow missed the last chance to expose Kylista and her minions for the hypocrites they truly are!"
"I work in the sawmill here in Minoc."
"I like the town, but 'tis so far from Britain that it attracts some truly... unusual people."
"Thy companions will have to carry some of these useless things."
"So, leave thou before I grow tired of thee and thou dost feel the wrath of Ensorcio the Adept!"
"Surely, a fine young warrior like thyself dost plan to partake in the Quest to retrieve the Helm of Monitor?"
"And people accuse me of being forgetful! Thou art a Knight, and doth ask me about Monitor?"
"If thou changest thy mind, thou hast but to return and ask again."
"Father was the blacksmith. I cannot believe that he has been murdered! He had no enemies that I know of. Unless it was The Fellowship."
"Perhaps thou didst speak too soon, my friend..."
"I teach expertise with light weapons here in Moonglow."
"If thou art caught cheating, thou wilt be arrested. And we do prosecute!"
"No job is had by me. Food is gathered by me and my family."
"Failure in StartTournament() because we couldn't push an item into the ethereal void."
"Sometimes, I despair of ever being free to enter the Void."
"Relax and be at ease..."
"I have lived here in Paws all my life. I will not leave it now. I shall never leave."
"Thou art certainly a fast talker. I will have to watch thee carefully..."
"Please come to my studio during business hours if thou wishest to train."
"Thou dost not have enough gold for that!"
"Never mind the legends of hidden treasure chambers here. If there were gold here, I would have it by now!"
"Goth. Not that it is any of thy business!"
"I'll wager that chest is locked. If we had lockpicks, however, we could open it!"
"Thou art mad! I was with Number 5 when Number 7 disappeared!"
"How may I serve thee, noble Pikeman?"
"There must be something wrong..."
"To have seen two stone pillars of great size, in the semblance of serpents."
"It is my job to keep records during the meetings, and to administrate the decisions of this branch."
"Thou shouldst also speak with Andral, the sculptor. He and the sage spent many hours in conversation, here at the inn."
"I always have time for those who come seeking knowledge. Be welcome."
"Oh, she must be quite a ravishing maiden if he is willing to risk life and limb to come down here and prove his virtue."
"I do not remember what they look like. I did not recognize them. They were most likely some other members of The Fellowship."
"Not in the mood for a bell today?" She wrinkles her lips in the best attempt at a smile. "Perhaps something else will strike thy fancy."
"Then open thy mind to me, and let me withdraw the knowledge which I lust after!"
"But, now that thou art here, feel assured that I will remain vigilant against anything that would deter thee from thy destiny."
"My fellow Lords are Gustacio and Mortegro."
"My patients here in Moonglow. Who will help them if not I?"
"It must have been the Goblins! I refuse to weep. But I vow that the first dozen Goblins I slay shall be for him!"
"Give Yenani bucket of Ice Dragon blood. She know what to do with it."
"Here they are."
"So, thou art returned... Failed in thy puny quest already, Pikeman?"
"Petra, honestly!"
"Thoxa overstepped her bounds by giving thee the Hourglass of Fate."
"Tsk, tsk. Thou dost not have enough gold for the service. I do hope I may help thee another day."
"Suit thyself... It is thy loss."
"I ask thee again -- surrender those stockings to me!"
"Thou dost not have enough experience. Come back when thou art more knowledgeable of the world!"
"I must return to my duties..."
"To have not that much gold! To perhaps return with more and purchase the service then."
"Thou canst tell Jendon that this is no goblin skull. He will have to find something else to hang above his door."
"His name is Kessler."
"The storms will not end until the blight of the blasphemers' existence hath been wiped from Beauty's face!"
"He is a wise man who knows many things and tells wonderful stories. Alagner came here to retreat from the outside world. I know not why."
"This is thy last chance -- wilt thou tell me the secret which I desire, the key to controlling Daemons!!!"
"Very well... Consider each question carefully before answering."
"If thou dost not show, then I shall know thee for the coward thou art."
"Then I shall give thee the benefit of the doubt for now. But know that I do what I must to protect our Guild."
"He be in here every night after work. Good man, hard worker."
"We also accept other precious items..."
"But I cannot recall having seen thee in Fedabiblio's training... But then I do not usually take much note of the novices."
"Couldst thou please make up thy mind!?"
"I helped to organize things with Mayor Burnside to get the monument built."
"Not good, that one. Sought to reach beyond life and rule death. Not good."
"I can only be disturbed for a moment, as the others will miss me. We must continue our Dirge."
A sword may protect thee from the Rat-Men, but only magic can save thee from the fearsome heat.
"They say that thou hast been making friends with young Alyssand, the weaver. I think we, too, could be friends."
"Wouldst thou like to meet later?"
"And I know exactly where and how to use it..."
"Wouldst thou like another spell?"
"Pull every other lever down to break free of the trap."
"Thou dost already have that spell!"
"That is as much as the storm took from me..."
"It hath been years since I last talked with anyone. Thou wouldst not believe how lonely the life of a dragon can be."
"We were playing cards in the pub. Damn me if he did not deal from the bottom. I can usually spot tricks like that, but he was good!"
"Thou hast just missed them! They were here collecting funds. They have moved on to Paws to visit our Shelter there."
"I shall never speak to thee again!"
Day 167 -- More men are fighting amongst themselves.
"The Temple is located beyond the palace, on the waterfront. 'Tis dedicated to Beauty, as is all of Fawn."
"Thou canst buy no reagents in Moonshade, for the Apothecary hath gone away!"
"I run The Blue Boar. Oldest tavern in Britannia."
The fighter shrugs. "The town is all right." He sniffs.
"Thou cannot possibly carry that much!"
"Thou hast better not visit this shop too often, or we shall lose all our money!"
"Together, none can stand in our way!"
"This is not a good time, my love. Perhaps thou couldst come some other morning."
"I am the King ov the Gypsies."
"Why wouldst thou want to talk about them? The storms are much more fun..."
"Dost thou know nothing? When we die, our bodies are placed in the ground, but our souls rise to the Void."
"We also nurture many root crops, and make flour from their tubers."
"Oops. I did give thee one!"
"We are working on a play at the moment."
"May I see this evidence?"
"To have returned with amulet?"
"Since when art thou a guide? Back to work!"
"I thank thee, kind lady. I know not how to repay thee."
"We may be on the ship, but the ship is upon dry land! I think that thou art correct, Iolo. We did fly!"
"In a moment, automaton."
"Enough, arrogant fool! Thou canst not kill a Xenkan Monk!"
"Thou didst not know? That urn holds the ashes of one of Monitor's dead warriors."
"This is no time for idle chat. We're on a quest!"
"Thou dost not have enough monetari to purchase this..."
"That is what I am seeking to do!"
"If thou wantest to know more, speak to Caladin or Marsten -- they deal with outsiders."
"Came on the ship. Said The Fellowship had sent them here to study our way of life -- make maps, collect histories, and so forth."
"This isn't the place for a long talk, mate. Meet me later, back at the tavern, and we'll talk more."
"I could sell thee several spells, Mage..."
He continues hammering on a strangely-shaped iron cage.
"I am sorry. A better time to discuss this would be when my shop is open."
"If thou dost answer it correctly I shall give thee a more dificult riddle."
"Dost thou have something thou wishest me to look at?"
"Wouldst thou like to purchase anything else?"
"Breath doth return to the body. Thy comrade is alive!"
"I can tell thee from whence the Serpent Teeth came..."
"Thou dost dare lie to me! I shall make thee pay!"
"Whew. Thou didst frighten me!"
"It is not mine, but I cannot tell thee to whom it belongs. Only Master Ducio would know."
"Forgive my presumption, Kylista. As the Priestess of Beauty, thy powers are absolute within this Temple."
"A hardy bunch, are we not? Not as hot-headed as those Bears, and much more tightly knit than those Leopards."
"How exotic -- armour made for a woman! 'Tis too beautiful to come from Monitor, and no ranger here wears such a thing..."
"Come! Come and witness mine ascent to power."
"I can give thee 1 monetari for every 2 gold coins thou hast."
"Thou dost have wheat for brains! Thou hast not room for a single banana!"
"The mead Rocco imports is sweetly flavored with the honey of bees raised in the mountain highlands."
"Good ta see thee again."
"There are many fine exhibits in our museum. Thou shouldst especially note the artifacts captured from the Goblins..."
You see a very distraught gargoyle.
"I think that her visions had left her and she slunk quietly away to die in obscurity."
"Every citizen of the town must become a Knight of Monitor, or be banished when they reach the age of fifteen."
"Thou hast not enough gold for that!"
Lasher shakes his head sadly. "No, thou merely thinks thou dost know what a unicorn is, but I shall tell thee the truth.
"I have had the chance to spend a few hours in the company of the Mage Frigidazzi, on whose account thou hast been imprisoned."
"In life, I was Sansalys, the keeper of the Library of Chaos. Alas, the books are taken, except for a few."
"Not in me wildest dreams, Komor.*"
"Well! I thought thou wert my friend!"
"Gwenno! It must have been Gwenno!"
"They say he lives there still, feeding off any who pass by. One thing's certain, the goblins don't go near that place to this very day."
"Hello, good friend," says Malloy. "A pleasure to see thee again."
"Thou knowest -- the quests to prove that thou art fit to bear thy Knighthood..."
"I saw several in empty goblin campsites when we tried to route the goblins from this area."
"See, their desire to please thee hath clouded their minds..."
"Did I not tell thee that I am no loonie? Still, my story of how I did come across this thing is beyond belief."
"Thou art a lout not to pay me!"
"Thou shalt see the power of the King of the White Dragon!"
"Someone in Monitor is a thief. Money is being taken from the treasury. 'Tis a mystery."
The winged gargoyle begins his sermon.
"One word of warning about Mack. Do not let him start talking about the sky. Other than that he is perfectly fine, I can assure thee."
"Thou shouldst ask Mistress Devra about that. All I know is that one day no one could find Silverpate, and he was never found."
"It is very large. Keeps me very busy. Thou wouldst not believe how dusty it gets."
"Sadly, his shop is closed today. He hath not been seen for some time."
"Dost thou agree to my rate?"
"Except, perhaps, thyself? I must believe that thou hast had thy share of conquests in thy time..."
"Dost thou find the rate acceptable?"
"See? I told thee!"
"Thou canst find her mansion in the northeast part of town, built into the face of the southern mountains."
"The women of Fawn are the most beautiful in the land, but they are overly pampered."
"'Twill hurt, but I have no choice but to accept it at this price."
"Stop the Avatar! I will come through the Black Gate now! Do not let him near!"
"I have some of thy belongings in my possession. Wouldst thou like them returned?"
"And I am the Lady of Fawn! Thou wilt not go far with such here, stranger." *"What is thy business here in Fawn?"
"Dost thou not know that it is a crime to possess Stoneheart! It is a most dangerous substance."
"To be the inner voice of guidance that lives in all creatures. To become more distinct and frequent with stronger Fellowship ties."
"Yes, what can I do for thee?"
"Thou hast come to beat me again, I know it!"
"Thou hast no proof! Both Number 2 and Number 6 can attest that I was with them when Number 7 disappeared!"
"Two of these signs are either true or false!"
"In truth, my cooking ability doth do Torrissio no small credit. And I dare say that it wins him many customers as well."
"Want to try some spinning..."* "...and dying, Avatar?"
"To thank you for this information. To be pleased to know the identity of my assailant."
"Please come to The Mint during regular daytime hours."
"Thou dost bargain well, hero. I will accept this price."
"Dost thou want the Talisman of Love?"
"As for Adept Rotoluncia, she is steeped in magic and a mistress of the arcane. Do not provoke her, for her anger is terrible."
The gargoyle has a pleasant expression on his face.
"Then perhaps later."
"Now, as I promised I reward thee with a valuable secret."
"Thou mayest not judge the Avatar by this mark alone!"
"The Banes are the splintered force of Chaos."
"Wouldst thou like something else?"
"I have already mentioned the Opidian civil war, but I don't think thou art aware of the the liche known as Aram-Dol."
"Yes, that's Iolo!"
"Thou shouldst have understood -- a woman cannot be left to control a city! They have not the brains for such matters!"
"Or dost thou wish to be a king?~"Yonder sticks a sword in stone.~"If thou canst only pull it out~ "Thou wilt be the next upon the throne!"
"Ask me again when thou dost have a spellbook!"
"They were from Buccaneer's Den. Most people that come here come because they are lost on their way to or from Buccaneer's Den."
"Karnax did tell me that Miggim doth have maps to the various temples..."
"I am no mage, to tell thee such things!"
"It hath been a long time since we last saw Gwenno. Many months."
"Cador oversees the mines. He and his wife, Yvella, have a lovely daughter named Catherine."
"Avatar! Release thou me from this vile cell!"
"Without the fine aid of the Pikemen, these poor sailors and I would have been lost long ago."
"I am Melino, husband of the Green Enchantress."
"Use the tooth that I have given thee! Seek the Dead on the Isle of Crypts."
"When a man ages, he starts to lose his mind. Wouldn't want mine Alyssand to have to deal with someone like that..."
"How quaint. Take it with thee when thou leavest..."
"How many wouldst thou like?"
"I am the director of this Meditation Retreat for Fellowship members."
"As the course of destiny calls us to many places and many worlds throughout the universe, mine ancestors grew wings to travel far."
"'Tis in the building just northeast of the Brotherhood. I know they keep prisoners there."
"Perhaps Fawn's luck shall change after all!"
"Dost thou not need to rest thyself, Templar? Thou hast had no time to heal from thy wounds."
"Last one we had was killed by the Goblins a few months ago. Closest thing we have now is the herbalist, Delphynia."
"We would come here yearly to hear the words of the Master of Emotion, and to drink of the Water of the Temple."
"Let us hear from the next witness."
"If thou dost want to show Julia the plans, I will give them to thee. They are in my cabin southeast of the BMC office."
"Call the Rangers! Consult the Mages! Such a crime cannot go unpunished."
"Art thou sure thou dost want me to leave?"
"Thou dost not have enough gold."
"Oh. Hello. I am Nell."
"Unfortunately, I am having a problem with most of mine other magical powers."
"Lucilla would not pay the price that I have, to be so alone. Do not weep for me, my friend -- I am proud of who I am."
"Until thou art ready to join, I cannot tell thee any more about the test."
"Thou hast not the gold for that!"
"I have many friends here. When I am lonely, I speak with Alagner the Sage, Russell the shipwright, or Henry the peddler."
"None have returned from that dank, dark abyss."
"It is run by a man named Morfin, a very successful merchant from Buccaneer's Den."
"Here is the key to my storeroom. There thou wilt find the secret of teleportation. It is an old serpent jawbone."
"No, I will not! This is my shield, and it hath been mine since my father -- a great Knight of Monitor -- passed it on to me!"
"These were mine exact words, Lady -- All hail Lord British and the glory that is Britannia!"
"Of course, there is my aunt's son Longtooth. A sorrier dragon thou shalt never find! Of course, what happened to him was not his fault."
"Thou hast not the amount of gold thou dost want to bet! Art thou trying to swindle me?"
"Shows what thou knowest, Jendon. We bards would call that a tragedy."
"Ye got ta lighten yer load first!"
"As thou hast aided me in mine experiments, I shall teach thee spells free of charge."
"I Re-Ten Bentas Juxark I!"
"Avatar, 'tis the pelts! They can smell that we have Gwani pelts on us! I suggest we throw them away!"
"Listen carefully..."
"I thought as much."
"Thou hast beaten me, vile human. I will remember this day!"
"To ask if you are willing to take the Test. To prove that you are the Hero of which we dream."
"Oh! One of thy friends hath met an untimely end. This should not be..."
"Perhaps another time."
"Thou must be a seeker after knowledge. I am the Mage Fedabiblio, and I serve as the Magister of Moonshade."
"Mine half-sister and I have no job at this time. We are journeying to seek inner peace, now that our quest has been aborted."
"Only by renouncing thy friend and patron, the ruler who sent thee here, canst thou hope to continue on."
"Moonshade, the city of wonders! And the city of charlatans!"
"Do not return until thou hast done so."
"Petra is an automaton. She is Torrissio's master work... She looks exactly like a real woman, but of metal. She's quite remarkable."
"Exactly so!"
"It all becomes clear!"
"and I would recommend against that --"
"The tradition doth date to the ancient city of Moon, from whence our ancestors came."
"I cannot help thee until mine Orb, the Heart of Elerion, is returned..."
"Wilt thou buy?"
"The deed to the ship 'The Beast' costs eight hundred gold pieces. Dost thou wish to purchase her?"
"I be hired as a bodyguard for Master Robin, as is me partner, Leavell. The pay be good."
"They waste too many hours at the List Fields, fighting any who will challenge them."
"The land would soon be overrun by disease and vermin!"
"Believe me, I am allowing thee a fantastic price. Please do not tell anyone!"
"Thou dost not?! Why, do not be ridiculous! Of course thou dost!"
"Frederico was the leader of the Gypsies, and Tania was his wife. They lived outside of town. I know nothing more about them."
"Thou dost have no gems! Thou art a liar! I will do no business with thee!"
"Art thou certain thou hast not cast a dweomer upon me? I usually do not lower my prices so."
"So 'tis thee again. Well met! How shall I aid thee?"
"The smithy is currently closed for outside business. Thou shalt have to return some other time."
"Argus is... or was... a member of the Wolf Command."
"Well, I mean Lord British and his advisors."
"Then in an emergency, I shall find thee at the Town Hall in Monitor."
"'Tis not all thou wert a connoisseur of," adds Paulette, eyes twinkling. "I seem to remember thou had quite a taste for redheads."
Beware, dear reader, for the beasts of Chaos are watching each of thy steps.
"Nor can I take thy money for one. Here, I shall return it to thee."
"Remember this well. It may mean the difference between thy life and thy death."
"Give me a good challenging search any day! The harder something is to find, the better I like it."
"Baiyanda teach me about plants and things."
There is a flash of what can only be described as black light and the sword is wrenched out of your grasp and falls to the ground.
"What dost thou wish to purchase?"
"I think he was more disturbed by thy departure than he cared to show. Or else they have told him something..."
"He is the MageLord of all Moonshade. There are rumors that no mage hath lived who was more powerful, not even the Mad Mage!"
"And also the private passions of these people! This is such fun, Avatar."
"To have brought me something, some evidence about the rumors?"
"Lydia, Lucilla, Shazzana, Cellia, Harnna..."
"However, Columna found out that I stole them, and she wants mine head on a platter. Literally!"
"Thou dost already have that spell!"
"It was designed so that we might be able to gauge when certain events were nigh. Perhaps it will serve thee better. I do not know."
"Please go and recover it then. I believe it contains information that may help my companion."
"The Mandrakes are only found in the swamplands, and only when the salt tides are right."
The ape-like creature slowly and cautiously walks up to you. He, or she, sniffs for a moment, and then points to the honey you are carrying.
"I assume that the gauntlets are thine... They are clearly meant for someone more adventurous than a mere weaver."
"The writings of Xenka speak of the Three which shall travel with thee. Without them, thou canst not succeed."
"They've become bolder here of late. That's why Fawn closes her gates at night now."
"Hast thou not heard? Lady Yelinda doth look to the young woman as her chief advisor!"
"I also wonder. But the doings of those who travel upon it are more familiar to me. I have seen pirates land upon the northern coast."
"The three principles are: Strive for Unity, Trust thy Brother -- and sister -- and Worthiness precedes Reward."
"If thou dost become a Knight of Monitor -- which is highly unlikely by the looks of thee -- thou shalt not be a Bear."
"I have been tricked! Avatar! I beseech thee! Help me before..."
"'Tis a drink from the heavens. Thou shouldst try it."
"Then use it! Use it to numb the tyrant Draygan!"
"Take no hope that thou wilt remain any longer than necessary for thee to speak before the Oracle."
"Mmmm! Sounds good to me! Next time we pass a place, let us stop!"
"The revelations assure us that the heavens have not totally turned their eyes from Fawn."
"No doubt we shall be in many strange dungeons before our adventure is over..."
"Perhaps we should go find Shamino and have him join us as well."
"To be amused to see them come again and again, only to die. To survive long enough to vex us with their weapons, before their deaths."
"Oh, I speak blasphemy! But I cannot take back my words..."
"The writings are vague on this point, so that it is not certain whether the Power lives in the Void now, or merely came from that place."
"Thou art a fool, to turn thy back on coins freely offered."
"'Tis truly amazing... thou hast a facile tongue to convince me to lower my price by so much."
"Place the Staff, Armour, and Crown on the Altar."
"It was such a wonderful ceremony! The old Master would pass from chamber to chamber, collecting the four Lodestones of Emotion..."
"What canst thou tell us of home? What news of his noble cause?"
"Before the Hound of Doskar can track, thou must show it an item belonging to the person whom thou dost wish to seek."
"Pleasant dreams, Avatar..."
"But, as long as Filbercio is the MageLord, thou wouldst do well to remember that it is unhealthy to cross any of Filbercio's whims."
"Thus, Emotion is the most important of the Virtues."
The Time Lord looks relieved.
"When Filbercio sentenced him to death in the Mountains of Freedom, I laughed until blood ran from mine eyes!"
"Art thou in need of healing, curing, or resurrection?"
"Besides the MageLord, there are two others who compose the Council of Mages."
"In which circle art thou interested?"
"To say that these invaders cannot stand the heat of this place! To quickly die."
"I do not wish to burden thee with my personal problems. The less said of these things, the better."
"And in Moonshade, women may be mages... But the true power lies in the hands of men."
"What about them? They did not bother me. We cannot let them control our lives!"
"Thou wilt not find our cooking fancy as in Moonshade. But 'tis hardy fare and thou wilt find the portions ample."
"Do not ask me why he is called that! Everyone there calls him that, though!"
"Here is the locket. Take it."
"Nothing, Lord Draygan."
"One of you wishes to train?"
"Such items are very valuable here, felon. Thou mayest find the prices steep..."
"Dost thou wish me to repeat a song thou hast already heard? Or dost thou wish to hear a new song?"
"Listen carefully..."
"My job is to oversee the stables here in Britain and sell thee a horse and carriage if thou dost want one."
"Thou dost surprise me. Most Mundanes are frightened by the very idea of sorcery."
"Enough with this maudlin waste of time! Back to work with thee, Vasel!"
"No, we must wait until this weather clears before we can hope to begin rebuilding our fleet."
"Thou art a fine one! I thought we had an agreement."
"Leon's companions are the sailors that brought him here. Their names are Scots, Ruggs and Kalen."
"Perhaps thou shouldst talk vith him."
"What spell wouldst thou like to buy?"
"Ah, but I can tell that thou dost want mine hidden knowledge. It will do thee no good! I shall keep my secret."
"Now, now, Avatar, that would be revealing. Then I would have no secret from thee, would I?"
"Hast thou returned with the scroll?"
"Thou art wasting thy fetid breath making the Avatar such an offer!"
"Dost thou find me beautiful? I admit I love the attention! But I have never found the right man for me..."
"If there is such a thing as a little spirit girl, then that is what I am."
"They say that he is crazy, but I think there is prejudice everywhere against necromancers. He is not that bad."
"I was in league with Lord Marsten, who schemed to become King of Monitor. The Bears and Wolves would have been powerless!"
"To know many of the residents in town, and some of the troubles."
"What!? Frigidazzi, why is this stranger in thy chambers?!"
"Now I've got no husband and a pair of old, smelly boots."
"Let me think a moment. I am terrible with names like this... Aha! I have it! The old lands were known as Sosaria."
"What wouldst thou like to buy?"
"Rabindrinath releases his anger by troubling the thoughts of those who venture here within their dreams."
"Yes, I have heard of these people and I don't particularly care for them."
"I ask thee again -- surrender those stockings to me!"
"It is a sound thou wouldst find most unpronounceable. My name is a word in the language of my kind that roughly translates as 'Skyrise'."
"Soldiers... Discipline... fountain..."
"All right."
"The highest station which a male can hope for is to serve as one of the Great Captains. These men serve as Lady Yelinda's advisors."
Gargan coughs loudly.
"Are not they the neatest, most orderly, and well-kept shelves thou hast seen? They do an excellent job of maintaining them!"
"Yea verily, Fenn and I share all that we own. Which, in its totality, is the clothes on our backs and the snot in our throats!"
"A word of advice: If thou desirest to be accepted in Monitor, thou shouldst consider taking the Test of Knighthood."
"Thine impudence is beyond belief! Always, 'tis the superstitious and the jealous who persecute the Necromancer..."
"Thou dost not have to give me anything to prove thy love. That thou art here now is proof enough."
"As I have finished my workday, I ask thee to come back another time. Thou dost have my thanks."
"I have this strange foreboding..."
"Or at least that is what we all thought until he disappeared. Perhaps we have been harboring another Vasculio all this time."
"...And here comes part of it now."
You see a young, bewitching gypsy woman with wise, soul-peering eyes.
"Ah, thou art correct, daughter..."
"If thou wert a person of truly refined taste, thou wouldst buy some!"
"Perhaps I could find another song for thee..."
"I am glad that I was able to give thee thy gauntlets. I had no use for them, and I am sure that thou didst miss their protection."
"Only Frigidazzi knows what happened for certain. And I would not care to ask her about it, either!"
"I miss that fellow!"
"Thou dost not have the guilders to pay me!"
"Wish I knew. He doth charge at me when I least expect it. Sometimes he appears from thin air!"
"How many dost thou want?"
"Fiery explosions! Wild animals! Puzzles to queer the mind, and mysteries beyond the understanding of mortals!"
"It is indeed true."
"I shall not take this deception lightly."
"Why, if I accepted such a price as this, I should have to break Petra into scrap metal and sell her to make ends meet!"
"They used to come to us for everything from healing arts to weather predictions. Of course, that was before the storms began."
"He now calls himself Shamino the Anarch."
"My cure can have only a temporary effect, for thou art enthralled by a powerful disease."
"I am flattered Boris would buy me such an obviously expensive gift. But how could he ever have afforded it?"
"He did try to steal a kiss from me!"
You see your old friend Nystul, now a decrepit old man in mage's robes. He seems lost in thought, far away.
"Thou art nearly dead, Avatar!"
"I fear that my companions and I will be the next delicacy in the Goblin stewpot."
"Thou art a member thyself."
"She is an elderly mage who lives in Moonglow."
"And I would advise thee to use great caution about who thou dost ask... lest thou dost find thyself thrown in the dungeons."
"Whoever betrayed Astrid's patrol must have been a Knight -- no one else could have done it."
"Here it is."
"What dost thou say to this?"
"Wouldst thou like something else?"
"We have quite a collection of diverse books and scrolls -- all meant to help us aid thee on thy quest."
"To have been commanded to protect the people who live in Serpent's Hold and to maintain the general order of the knights."
"Since thou dost not have enough room for this last item, I will place it at thy feet."
"Relax and be at ease..."
"I spit upon thee, pawn of the Demon British!"
"Wilt thou come quietly?"
"This cave was perfect for me. I could come and go as I pleased, at least until Aram-Dol started expanding his territory."
"Thou hast spoken to the Tortured One and learned the answers to the questions of Life and Death?"
"Thou hast not enough gold to pay me. I am sorry but I cannot train thee now."
"Ah, this poison I can remedy. A moment... *There, 'tis done. Thou art whole once more."
"They were wrong. They paid for their foolishness and greed with their lives."
"He is a close and trusted advisor to Filbercio, the MageLord of Moonshade and senior member of the Council."
"A sturdy lad, Keth was. 'Twere a pity ta lose him."
"I hope that thou shall find it useful to thee."
"I see thee draw thyself up... Have I offended thee? And what wilt thou do, hero? Imprison me? Or wilt thou simply murder me?"
"Thou hast a good eye for a bargain..."
"I am sorry, but I have too many other patients to help thee now. Perhaps when I next open my shop."
Paul enters the stage with Meryl, who now wears a different mask.
"Now that be truly difficult, too."
"They have been very convincing."
"Yes. What is wrong with that?"
"The great archer himself, Iolo, started that branch more than two hundred years ago."
"Brunt, Ruggs, Deadeye, Kalen... I found them congenial enough. Excepting Kalen... he enjoyed arguing with my customers."
"Follow the Kings' Road north of Monitor, then take the trail leading west."
"Wilt thou follow me? I can help thee escape to save those that thou lovest."
"Wouldst thou care for more?"
"Oh, I am afraid I cannot tell thee anything about that. After all, I was merely the Mad Mage's assistant."
"Now that thou hast completed the Knight's Test, thou must now bring me the meat for thy banquet stew."
"If thou wouldst ever change thy mind thou needest only let me know."
Once thou dost have the Forces of Order in thy life thou shouldst have no emotion.
"Excellent, thou art uninjured!"
She sighs, obviously disappointed.
"Thou canst get a good meal there! But I could give thee a good -clue-!"
"He travelled with a Daemon named Palos. Where did Batlin obtain such power? If I had this power, I could rule Serpent Isle!"
"Then thou shalt not pass."
"Good! Thou hast brought it with thee -- and now I shall take it!"
"But no, that cannot be. For Number 7 disappeared the day I was with Number 3, long before the strange mage came."
"That is the name of my son. 'Tis a good name, yes?"
"To have no desire to tell you. To demand to know who you are!"
"What is this I hear?"
You see a woman who oozes partially sincere friendliness.
"Ask Spark about it. He may know something."
"Acting is the highest form of art. It allows one to step outside oneself and become another person. 'Tis like a game!"
"Without thine aid we are doomed to eternal limbo, not dead and never to be alive again. Trapped forever in insanity."
"Wouldst thou like to know more of The Fellowship?"
"I do not recall having met thee before..."
"Then I have a mission for thee."
You see a very large, strong wingless gargoyle.
"What?! I should have known that evil tyrant would yet live! Beware -- no servant of the Beast shall be aided by any Knight of Monitor!"
"I am afraid I must first see what thou art referring to before I can answer thy question."
"To ask how I may assist, human."
"Pothos! I should send thee to the dungeons and have the rats feed on thy carcass!"
"From his dead body was taken the Helm of Courage, and his ashes are enshrined in Knight's Test."
"If everyone learned to listen to their Inner Voice, I could return to Britannia and farm contentedly for the rest of my life."
You notice the Cube has been vibrating while Danag was speaking.
"How many different materials can armour be made from?"
"Batlin, that was it. He called himself the Sage Batlin."
"I do not know! These forsaken prophecies are so poorly written that I cannot make any headway in finding any reference to any other!"
"Some other time, then."
"Join us now and thou wilt see. ~Join thy brothers and our plan ~To promote the tenets of our group -- ~Thou wilt be a better man."
"I have a book here that Adjhar said told about... our... creation. This might help bring him back."
The Hero From Another World is there...
"Dost thou want me to wait here or should I go home?"
"Retract thy words, or eat them! Thou art speaking about the Avatar!"
"But why hast thou come to our town? What is thy business here?"
"Art thou ready to pay thy bill?"
"This is the very same practice sword that Cantra used every day."
"Why hast thou not taken the energy globe which I did give thee to the tower on the plains?"
"I feel so comfortable around thee. It is as though we have known each other before -- perhaps in some other existence?"
"Doth not sound like something a fisherman would wear..."
"The whole scheme was his -- not mine! I did only what I was told. He forced me to serve him..."
"Thou hast learned to value Ethicality over money... Thou art worthy to continue the test! Behold!"
"I see thou dost have a quantity of silver snake venom in thy possession. Perhaps we should talk further."
"Take me with thee! Please! I must avenge Father's death! If thou dost not take me with thee, I will follow thee anyway!"
"But the Goblins did not take her!"
"There were three with him, so I was told."
The very serious man breaks into a half-smile as he greets you.
"Thy travels shall take thee north. Far north through caves that lie to the west... I can feel the cold wind blowing upon thee."
"Art thou here to aid me in healing my brother?"
"Goodness, I hope that doth not happen to me!"
"I don't speak with strangers!"
"Do not smirk! The Command of the Bear is unmovable. The Goblins dare not assault Monitor, for they know that we are here."
"Well, on second thought, it looks like too big of a crowd. I do not like crowds."
"Nice day we're having, isn't it."
"Be careful of that one. He is nothing but trouble."
"To have healed the wounds."
"Every night at nine o'clock we have a meeting in the Fellowship hall. Thou mayest consider thyself invited to attend."
"I know that one! It is written entirely in Serpent Runic, and kept in the library of the Seminarium."
"What wouldst thou like to buy?"
"Since thou wilt not give me thy secrets, I shall obtain them from him!"
"Now I must kill thee, lest the Serpent judge me unworthy. Bless my blade, master!"
"I was once flesh and blood, like thee, a warrior of Order. I was chosen to be tested shortly before the war began."
"Thou must draw straws to see who the Monitor crematorium awaits."
"I am amazed to hear that Marsten hath betrayed us. I cannot believe it."
"All I know is that it is being built on the Isle of the Avatar."
"Fedabiblio is the master archivist in the city of Mages. He is also a teacher, and will be able to help thee."
"Early today I play! I like look at clouds! Other day I saw one that look like penguin! Later, mother and Baiyanda teach lessons."
"I am the Lycaeum head here in Moonglow, but," he leans close to you, "mine assistant, Zelda, does most of the work."
"What coinage dost thou want?"
Zorn takes the Caddellite from you and begins his work.
"Dost thou wish to buy some spells?"
"I recall that one morning Mistress Devra was beside herself with worry because Angus was nowhere to be found."
"All right, here is one..."
"I am carrying many items, some of which may be of use to thee. Wouldst thou care to have these before I depart?"
"Why I be the barkeep of The Checquered Cork. No better place in Minoc to discuss the events of the day."
"Now I and one of my new friends shall go to a private chamber for some socializing... if thou knowest what I mean..."
"They would be Morfin, Andrew, Thurston, and Beverlea."
"Very well..."
"I spend so much time running around that I have gotten a bad foot."
"In order to do this, thou must be armed with three artifacts... the Artifact of Courage, the Artifact of Love, and the Artifact of Truth."
She shrugs.
"Come by the theatre during the day and watch the rehearsals for our play."
"I sense that thou wishest to know about the residents here at Serpent's Hold. Is this correct?"
"I do not know that ship."
"If ye be wantin' Captain Hawk, I'll be at the bottom of a mug at the Blue Boar Inn."
"Monitorians are not a superstitious people, yet we fear the ancient ruins."
"I do not stock such goods any more, but I know where they can be obtained -- Fawn, the sea-city."
"Poor woman, first Theron and then her husband..."
"Dost thou want me to wait here or should I go home?"
"Not bad... Not bad at all."
"Thou must mean Iolo, Shamino, and Dupre, of course."
"He contacted Alyssand, madam! I saw them speaking together, and casting many sly glances in my direction."
"I will carry some."
"It fulfills my life's purpose to teach others. It also gives me time away from home."
"Shamino the Anarch, thy wonderful companion, hath cast him from power and I have been welcomed with open arms!"
"In order for me to provide a permanent cure to thine affliction, thou must bring me five leaves of the Varo plant."
"There is a song about the other castle, as well." ~"Wouldst thou care to hear it?"
"Oh, my. Thine hands are too full to take the title!"
The reason that I wrote such a treatise is to sharpen thy fighting skills, but thou canst tell that is not a goal in itself.
"Why, thou mayest call me Brion."
"What weapon wouldst thou care to purchase?"
"I cannot recall what I did with it. Perhaps I still have it... Perhaps thou wilt come by some evening and I will look for it."
"Our prices are fair here."
"It is a pleasure doing business with thee!"
"I cannot identify the object if thou dost not show it to me. I will not waste my time making wild guesses."
"What is thy name?"
"But, thou art not the Hierophant. Pardon, mine energy is low."
"If there is a traitor, no doubt Lord Marsten shall unmask him. Meanwhile, I shall do my duty."
"As thou dost wish."
"I can train thee for 40 gold. Is this all right?"
"Quite right, Gustacio... and here is Adept Rotoluncia, whom I believe thou hast met."
"'Tis south of here. I do not associate with them. They are too warlike."
"Perhaps this is a clue to the strange disappearance of Selenia!"
"Thou canst find other spells without resorting to those that are restricted."
"As thou now knowest, she is most terrible to those who do not bend to her will."
"I am Magenta, of New Magincia."
"'Twas the bull's defeat that gave the village its name... And, in turn, became the name of the inn itself."
"This is not Moonshade, felon. My prices are fixed... Take them or leave."
"Larcenous bunch of armoured scum! They'll protect the roads for thee... if thou dost give them all thy money!"
"Come ta think of it, it looks like something that Jorvin was talking about, when our healer was killed. Thou shouldst show it to him."
"They are warriors that come from Monitor, a city south of here. Very brave. I can usually count on many tales from them."
"He is just an acquaintance."
"Thou hast destroyed it! All the mages thank thee!"
"Mayest thou walk in Beauty."
"To say that the Hero is most like you..."
"What dost thou care to exchange for guilders?"
"I know that bottle! That there is Moonshade wine."
"To be called Teregus."
"Of which type of place wouldst thou have me tell?"
He hands you a plate.
"It is written in the Ophidian runes, of course. But thou canst use the Lens of Translating to aid thee in reading it."
"There are relics from early Britannia and even from the Three Ages of Darkness -- back when Britannia was known as Sosaria."
"The Arabella."
"Fair enough, if I do say so myself."
"Good, I will be awaiting thy return!"
"What wouldst thou like to buy?"
"That looks like a pinecone to me!"
"I am sorry. All bets are off since the matter has been resolved."
"The Chaos Hierophant charged me with an important task... Who would have ever thought that I would be found worthy?"
"There are also the abominations called the 'Arachnians'."
"To be accepted."
"For the moment, let us assume that I am right and thou art wrong..."
"Other than her smile."
"And no one can explain the Serpent Gate, yet we have built our city above it."
"What wouldst thou like to buy?"
"Of what thou wouldst like."
"Take thy gold back! I cannot in good conscious keep it!"
"I know that the citizens talk of me all the time, behind my back. They say that I am a great lover, and indeed, I am!"
"Without the Crystal, our souls remain trapped. Bring to me the Dream Crystal and the Serpent Necklace is thine..."
"I need thine help! I need thine help! I am in so much trouble..."
Sintag glares at you.
"As thou hast seen or surely wilt see, this is not a place that sustains life. There is no safe way out of this place."
"I find it hard to believe that a man such as Hawk, with a ship such as the Arabella, would fear any storm -- magical or otherwise."
"Use it and thou shalt summon one of the great supernatural hounds from my world. Such a hound can track anything, over any distance."
"Voldin is perhaps the person who would most benefit from practicing Worthiness."
"Dost thou wish to commission a work from me?"
"I am glad thou wert able to successfully deal with him, without him getting the best of thee!"
"But then thou knowest all about Goblin treachery, being a Pikeman and all."
"Many ships come and go in our busy port. I do not know of any one specific ship. Perhaps thou shouldst ask Owen."
"Yes, there are marks here on the island that suggest that something was here until recently."
"I am Amber."
Kallibrus smiles and greets you with a nod.
"If thou wouldst please make thy request at a time that was during my normal business hours, I would be most grateful."
"Christopher's son is called Spark. Their house is in the northwest area of town."
"Only a devout student of Order would know the answer."
"Most ships have ceased to sail, for the storms strike any vessel which leaves harbor."
"Oh, this is horrible! Though I am but a woman of metal, I have a heart that feels pain for thee."
"Prepare thyselves..."
"Splendid. Then thou must really be the Avatar after all!"
"Thou art not the first to come to this isle in search of the Mandrakes, for the plant is the source of powerful magic."
"I have not had much business of late. I will accept thine offer."
"I can give thee 3 guilders for every 1 monetari thou hast."
My flesh doth rot.
"I am confounded by their inability to function properly."
"They brought thee here along their way to Minoc."
Come in and join the party...
"Why not say that thou art the new Lady of Fawn, whilst thou art about it, bold wench? Methinks that thy tales must be taller than mine."
"There once was a woman who cared for me, but we quarrelled. She, too, hath art in her soul, but she hides her secret well."
With additional notes by Dupre.
"Please do come and try thy skill when the facility is open for business."
"What wouldst thou like to buy?"
"The Goblins consider the pelts of the Gwani to be great prizes -- thou canst recognize a Goblin chief by the pelt he wears."
"Wilt thou give me a bit of money?"
"Everyone in town is all up in arms about this and that. But surely others would know more of these local politics. I care not."
"Do not interfere with me, Avatar!" ~"I am the MageLord now..."
"I have been here at Serpent's Fang longer than most. Perhaps I can aid thee with information. What dost thou wish to know of?"
"Simon would not taste very good anyway. I will kill thee now."
The mayor hesitates, then leans in to speak quietly.
"Rankin is very intelligent. He is the one who persuaded me to join The Fellowship. I have much respect for him."
"Yes, money! For I have found something here in New Magincia that will be worth more than gold in Buccaneer's Den."
"I do not know if it is their name for themselves, or if it is a name that he concocted for them."
"Some other time, then."
"The greatest battle of the Goblin wars took place in the days when Gurnordir was King of the Goblins."
"How many wouldst thou like?"
"Hero, listen to me before the fires consume me! Beware of thy friends -- they shall only bring destruction upon thee!"
You see a woman with a very serious look about her.
Lord British gives you the crystal, but it slips from your hands and falls to the floor. Luckily, it remains intact.
"But if thou dost find some, Yurel will still trade."
"To accept your offer."
"And then, in the hour of need, he selected me! Such an honor!"
"I used to be a farmer in more prosperous times. I used to work with Komor and Merrick."
The man before you seems to stare at you blankly.
"I am able to create or repair anything. I make what the Mages need. That makes me an Artisan."
"To perform assorted duties for town. To be a good, strong worker."
The runes must be placed left to right on the floor before the brass doors; any other placement will result in endless frustration.
"Since not one of you can hold another, I shall place this last remaining one upon the ground."
"We do our best to eat, sleep, and love each other down here isolated from the rest of society."
"It is good that thou didst tell me. One should always be honest in one's dealings with others. By the by, thy voice crackles too much."
"I am a magical construct. An animated body of metal."
"One must have money to drink, eh? I will accept this price."
"Aside from me, there be only old Delin the Provisioner, and he be half-crazy."
"It is thine!"
"Delphynia is Fawn's horticulturist and healer, of late. I met her when I accompanied Batlin into town for supplies."
Once infused with the soul of a glorious warrior, such gems are placed inside the automatons. This is what gives them true life.
"Perhaps thou couldst hire a captain in Fawn -- which is the city of fishermen -- or at the hamlet of Sleeping Bull."
"Mmmm. Thou wilt love it."
"Dost thou want to join?"
"I cannot tell thee very much about it. I fear that I only glanced at it... I would know it if I saw it again, though."
The gypsy woman peers into her crystal ball.
"I cannot imagine where Batlin is. I am worried about him..."
You can see the creativity literally flowing in abundance from this fellow. He looks at you with interest.
"Here is the key to room number 3."
"Thou art welcome to any of mine equipment. I keep it in a locked storeroom here in the castle. Thou wilt find the key in my study."
"I see. Well, thou best be on thy way, so that thou canst indeed get thine hourglass enchanted!"
"Thou dost not trust me, eh? So be it..." *"Ha! The stockings are now mine!"
"I shall return thy money."
"The lad doth have a point. Also..."
"Thou art in the Mountains of Freedom... A magical prison from which none have escaped."
"Without being able to actually look at the item thou hast mentioned, I can tell thee nothing."
"Strange lookin' brush..."
"A beggar man called Snaz will come to watch my show, ~"to steal and sell all my best jokes, mine own personal foe."
"What key? Dost thou have the key to Father's chest? Where is it?"
"We thought him dead, or deposed, yet he again speaks to Men -- though his power is a pale imitation of his former glory."
"Is this honorable? What of our agreement?"
You look De Snel in the eye and tell him that you found it at the scene of the murders in Minoc. He gives you a curious look.
"I wish a new Champion Knight would arise, one who can not only retrieve the Helm of Monitor, but also right the wrongs in this town!"
"Well, actually, 'tis the truth. A bad habit that I'd like to be rid of."
"Well, how many leather helms wouldst thou care to sell?"
"I cannot help but miss Dupre a little. I have not seen him since he was knighted."
"I must not say my name, lest I break the rule of The Game!"
"Thy suffering came from no accidental affliction -- the venom which mixes with thy blood is not common."
"How darest thou call me a bully! That little whore Lydia must have put thee up to this..."
"I came upon the ruins of a civilization in many places during my travels."
"He looks like a fine lad, he doth."
"Oh, the pain... The end is near..."
"Terandan is my name."
"I wonder... perhaps Rotoluncia could have had something to do with thy companion's demise?"
"Thou dost already have that spell!"
"Damn! How did she know?"
"To disbelieve that Men can believe us to be Daemons. To be Gargoyles."
"The other members are Gustacio and Filbercio, of course..."
"In my mind's eye, I see a large object shaped like a tetrahedron. I am beginning to understand what this is."
"Milady, this one is allied with that foul fiend, Beast British!"
"Thou hast not even called one person... No doubt thy trust in the Oracle's perception will be rewarded."
"Thou shouldst ask Julia, though. If anyone would know, it would be Julia."
"Is that not amazing? It doth go far beyond my comprehension of life and death. The mind fairly boggles at the ramifications of it."
"Be so kind as to return during normal training hours, wouldst thou?"
"Then thou shouldst go immediately to seek Batlin."
"I am not in the habit of running training sessions at this particular time."
"Good, thou hast the tooth that will take thee to Sunrise Isle!"
"Oh! One of thy friends hath met an untimely end. This should not be..."
"Next I remember, this beautiful woman was standing over me. She kissed me, and a warmth spread throughout my body..."
"To be protection against our enemies. To be lowered and raised by ancient levers."
"'Tis a woman, I know that, but I do not know her name."
You see a cheerful woman with bright eyes and blonde hair.
"The main stumbling block to Unity lies in a lack of Trust."
"Thou hast put the people in our town at ease by finding the culprit!"
"The only two memorable visitors we have had -- besides thyself -- were a fat sage and a scholar."
"To serve food and drink to others."
"What??! Oh, nothing, merely mentioning that we shall all miss her presence. She was a fine warrior."
The mage's eyes begin to glow softly. "My magic is strong enough to tear down the fabric of reality and reconstruct it as I see fit.
The Ferryman of Skara Brae stands in his spectral boat, holding out his hand for any who would pay his price.
"Thou dost bargain well. I will accept this price."
"But thou shouldst stay away from her, for she is the MageLord's mistress, and he is a jealous man!"
"But thou must be weary after takin' back the tower from those foul goblins. Pull up a chair an' we'll swap a few yarns over a cup or two."
"Our land is doomed unless we can restore it to Order."
"What wilt thou give me for a clue?"
"My responsibilities include caring for the trees, watching over the pickers at harvest time and protecting the Royal Orchard from thieves."
"Many thanks for returning my shield to me, friend."
"I was not about to let Cosmo venture down here by himself. So, I offered to accompany him, as did Kallibrus."
"Before all this evil at the sawmill, the buzz were all about the monument."
"My daughter have severe fever. She dying and only thou canst save her!"
"Be sure to come back if thou dost ever need any potions."
"Perhaps another time then..."
"Wilt thou agree to my rate?"
"They work on locked doors, too. Of course, we only use them for virtuous reasons -- the Avatar is no common thief!"
"I won't be asking what thou dost want it for. It is none of my business."
"But the uproar interrupted the funeral ceremonies."
"That is wonderful news! Lead on!"
"Now I must kill thee..."
"Dost thou want it for, say, 75 gold?"
"I think thou dost ask too many questions."
"Partners with Rotoluncia in politics. But partners with Columna in love."
"It is also the Crystal that traps any who enter the swamp."
"Thou shouldst not speak of the Lady so!"
"Thou hast acted correctly, Jorvin -- the Oracle hath just denounced them..."
"Doth not look like anything I ever heard of."
"Dost thou need healing?"
"If thou wantest to train, my charge is 30 gold. Art thou still interested?"
"The transaction is done!"
"The Green Sorceress, Columna -- she dresses in only the finest materials."
"Thou art very good at bargaining. I will accept this price."
Once the construction is complete, store the blackrock in the hold of The Crown Jewel.
"Our bravest warriors have many tattoos. Caladin and Brendann, rivals in all things, have more tattoos than anyone else in Monitor!"
"I shall speak with thee... for the moment."
"How can I be sure what use thou wilt make of this? I do not know..."
"Oh, let us not discuss this again..."
"I accept thine offer. Thou hast a fine eye for a bargain!"
"Our old friends -- Iolo and Shamino."
"Quickly! Surround Batlin!"
"Johnson."
"I collect magical items. The vault is full of them. Including this ring thou dost mention."
"Wouldst thou like something else?"
"Frankly, 'tis a mysterious place. I do not know much about it, except the legend that wise monks dwell there."
"Well now, deary, iffin I told ye what it were I'd jus' take the fun outta it fer ye. So ye go back an' have a look see fer yerself."
"Then we should have some before someone else does!"
"I sense that thou hast completed the Quest of the Three Artifacts."
"I'm a lucky man, to serve such a talented craftsman."
"Dost thou accept?"
"Observe the effects, and most importantly -- observe which color lightning hath which effect. Then return to me with thy report."
"Thou knowest Batlin?"
"Why, it certainly doth look like it... Alyssand will be so happy!"
"Very good!"
"That is, uh, not at all true!"
"On the night that Batlin the Sage left town, someone stole an ancient relic from mine home. I suspect that he was the thief!"
"She hath been made as disfigured as I am. Imagine, to plummet from Beauty to Ugliness!"
"Forgive me for my suspicions. But thou wilt understand that I take my responsibility seriously. I will now conjure a spellbook for thee."
"Thou d-d-dost n-n-not think I should join? C-C-Cubolt does not want m-m-me t-t-to either. I s-s-suppose I won't. I thank thee."
"Such perfidy makes my blood run cold. Have the traitors jailed until I decide what fate they deserve!"
"If I cannot stay here, I shall travel to Fawn. We can meet at the tavern there."
"Thy fire shall warm the heart of my trap, Palos. I shall rely on thee to make sure the Avatar feels the warmth of our welcome."
"Thou shouldst not travel so heavily burdened -- I do not think that thou canst bear the bottles that thou desirest!"
"Thou knowest this one..." "~Wouldst thou like to hear it again?"
The Cube continues to vibrate.
"Anyhow, Silverpate disappeared when Donal was still a young man. Everyone thinks the treasure is still hidden here somewhere."
"I can give thee 100 filari for every gem thou dost have."
Be also wary of those who weave spells, for they have no courage, and the cowardly weave webs of deceit, lies, and trickery.
"His killer deserves to die."
"Of what shall we speak?"
"Thou dost not have enough gold for that!"
"Dost thou wish another purchase?"
"Out-bargained by a stranger! What be next, a goblin?"
"So sayest thou, Olon. I think Alyssand's story qualifies well enough."
"Zhelkas said that the land would be better off without thee. The Guardian said that the end is inevitable. Why stay when we shall all die?"
"Another time, then."
"Yes, I could tell the answer to my question before thou didst even speak it. Art thou a virgin by choice or by circumstance?"
"I will need a bar of iron to complete the cage. Several can be found in the town cemetery."
"Thou art very good at bargaining. I will accept this price."
"Thou dost dare to interfere with my spells! MageLord, I demand that thou reprimandest this sorcerer."
"Mortegro's true specialty is speaking with the dead."
"And thou hast thy spellbook, so thou art not a Mundane. Therefore, thou art a Mage."
"I have acquired naught but half of my legacy... though I already have the power!"
"Oh, worry thyself not. I am not one to allow my needs to go unsatisfied."
"Dost thou think me a fool?! This little blue bauble is worthless!"
"Truly quite large, and not in the least bit attractive."
"I'll thank thee to keep thy comments to thyself, Jendon. Thou art ruining my tale."
"Dost thou not know that men are scum? Yet we cannot leave them alone..."
"To be known to you as Lap-Lem."
"Dost thou care to exchange more coins?"
"No dead animal flesh -- what is called `meat' by humans -- is eaten by an Emp."
"But I would rather discuss Brion."
"This is the cloak which thou must wear to the Ceremony of Initiation."
"Wherever I pass, people shall frolic and sate their wild desires! I shall drive thee to feed thy darkest hungers!"
"Frankly, I do not care to know much about that place."
"Thy room be upstairs."
"I was waiting until thou didst ask me!"
"Return in one day. I shall have thy cloak by then."
"Bah! She's no more afraid of those storms than thou art! She follows thee about right well enough, storm or no!"
"I shall open the Wall of Lights and destroy the world! And thou art powerless to follow me!"
"As a sign of mine appreciation and great affection for thee, please accept this gift. It is my greatest possession."
"Our ancestors did beat the British by escaping to this land. Is it so incredible that the Daemon would want revenge?"
"Oh, I knew by the nobility of thy face that thou wouldst take pity on a wretch such as myself!"
"Too small for me, I'm afraid. I don't think that these belong to any of the Rangers. Thou couldst ask Bucia."
"I fear Draygan more each day..."
"And now I would like to call..."
A large skull, no doubt belonging to some large and dead animal.
"Fool! Simpleton! Idiot! Thou hast condemned thyself to death!"
"I must help him, as he helped me! Wilt thou assist?"
"Back so soon? But of course."
Black Rock can be excavated by conventional means, but melting it down into a malleable substance is impossible, except by magic.
"Keep this book as a keepsake between us. Now I must go into the Void, but remember me always..."
"I am sure that this would free me from the stone..."
"I am here, father! Tell me how Freli fares. Hath he become a Mage?"
"How many dozen wouldst thou like?"
"We shall see about that!"
"Fruits are good and sweet -- like honey!"
"He is our town healer. He hath been here for years. Nice fellow."
"'Tis a good thing Petra escaped from his sickening clutches and has Rocco to protect her."
"In the Test of Knighthood, it is the Ashes which shall show thee thy totem animal. By the blood."
"I did see them, Captain, even if they did not see me. It is my business to watch strangers."
"I shall contact thee again, when perhaps thou shalt be more receptive to mine offers. Adieu."
"...Or his stewpot."
"Like Filbercio, Rotoluncia doth have a will of steel and a fiery temper."
"You are thanked."
"Do not go in! It is a trap! Do you not see? It is a trap!"
"I am sorry, but my dinner is waiting. We can talk again later."
"I am Morghrim, Master of these forests."
"Moonsilk stockings! Oh, how I have longed for a pair of my very own!"
"Perhaps when thou art carrying less I can give them to thee."
"Thankfully, Leon and his followers have been allowed to enter the city once again. I shall not fear for their safety now."
"Master, I have taken the time to speak with the Mages of this place. I do believe that the one known as Gustacio is of a mind to aid thee."
"We must mourn the fate of Chaos, for surely it hath been destroyed in this land. Order hath won."
"As thou dost wish, love."
"Captain Voldin, let us bring this session of the trial to an end."
"He is often at the tavern at this time. I do wish he would not go there every night with that... that... woman!"
"However, in her writings, Xenka hath promised to return to us when the end is near. She will then guide us once more."
"I see." *"Very well, I will agree to this price even though 'tis lower than I did expect."
"Dost thou wish healing?"
"Full of information, that chap. But he never seems to leave Britain anymore."
"Thou hast not the room for this cheese."
"It is a sad ballad indeed..."
"Please call me Auston."
"Ask in Fawn. He was proud enough about the ring. Someone will know who it belongs to."
"Freedom! What a farce!"
"Very well, but thou shouldst make up thy mind!"
"To refuse to give you the Ring of the Serpent. To ask that you submit further proof of your Virtue."
"Reveal to me the secret of controlling Daemonfolk, and I shall reward thee with power beyond thy comprehension."
"'Tis it, sure as the tide comes in! Keth flashed it around enough, I'd recognize it anywhere."
"Despite his blindness, Sir Jordan perceives objects around him very well. He is an excellent tinkerer, and can repair many items."
"I never thought that I would rue the day that another intelligent being learned the truths of The Fellowship."
"I have done this one for thee before..." "~Wouldst thou like to hear it again?"
"Like the cold spells she excels in, Frigidazzi certainly knows how to lower the temperature in a room..."
"I have not seen that one since I knighted him. Typical -- I do the man a favor and he disappears! I heard he might be in Jhelom."
"I am the guardian of the city of Order. Dost thou wish to enter the great city of Spinebreaker?"
"Lady Yelinda, as thou dost rule this city, dost thou wish to conduct the questioning?"
"Sleeping Bull is not exactly a town, but it doth lie on the road ta Monitor and is where thou mayest hire passage to Moonshade."
"Then here is thy key. Be happy! Oh, one more thing. There is a rule which must be followed."
"It was as if they knew our plans! They were lying in wait across our path, and were upon us in moments. What carnage!"
"There are three strangers on the island! They have been shipwrecked here! I have met them. Their leader's name is Robin."
"Nooo, master..."
"There is a thief running free in Paws! He stole silver serpent venom from Morfin, owner of the slaughterhouse. No one knows who he is."
"Who knows what ill is now loose upon the world!"
I have paid thee -- and paid thee well -- to fulfill the contract.
"I remember! I am Number 7!"
"I have no wish to cause disunity in thy city, Captain. I only wish that thou wouldst come to trust me."
"Thou dost not know about the Commands? All Monitorians belong to one of three Commands: the Bears, the Wolves, or the Leopards."
"What dost thou say to this?"
"Rocco, the innkeeper. A finer man thou shalt not find."
"Disturb me not! The flag is not finished! Come to my shop later."
"Thou must find the evidence that hath eluded us, so that Fawn can be freed!"
"For those who would hear a tale of bitter bravery, I can tell thee of the lost king."
"How would I know the mind of a madman?!"
"To have not enough gold to train here."
You see an attractive woman dressed in armour and carrying a small arsenal of weapons with her.
"It would be much simpler to view the play."
"Mangled will suffice, mighty Brunt. But do as thou wishest..."
"Moonsilk stockings! Oh, how I have longed for a pair of my very own!"
"Lady Yelinda will have to send her thanks back to Monitor."
"I seem to remember singing this for thee before..." ~"Wouldst thou like to hear it again?"
"This is the one and only piece of friendly advice I shall give to thee."
"Here they are."
"No, Jendon would not know what this is. Jendon is a city man and hath never been hunting with the guards."
"To make what purchase?"
"Can't git 'em now." ~"Ain't gonna sail my ship no more, and a ship is the only way past Gorlab Swamp."
"I am sorry, but that is not the correct answer."
"Such an odd little brush. I don't know why, but it doth give me a most unnatural feeling. Please, take it back!"
"Greetings. I'm a Pikeman of Monitor."
You see a man with a very worried look on his face.
"I do not know of any. I only just arrived here myself."
"That I am singing of my love in vain."
"Thou mayest call me Nelson."
It was reputedly a great item of magic. Didst thou find it so?" He cocks his head to one side as he asks the question.
"I have done all that I can."
"If that is what thou dost desire..."
"Look! A wondrous gem! This would easily buy enough provisions to last the entire quest!"
"Ah, I know just the one for a bold warrior as thyself! A tale ta stir the blood, that's for certain... the King of the White Dragon!"
"They could not have allowed someone as beautiful as thyself to be endangered!"
"Our 'ficial one went down with the Delyssia. Reckon I'm all there is now."
"However, I know that thou shalt need to seek out three artifacts -- a Ring, a Necklace, and an Earring."
"I thank ye for thy fish, as I do love it!"
"It is good that thou hast managed to create the magical formula; now must thou use it with the Soul Cage, to destroy Horance."
"Oh. Perhaps I have intruded upon thy dream."
"During a storm, the main mast was struck by lightning and came crashing down, jamming the winch that operated the sea anchor."
"Look at the size of that skeleton! Perhaps that skull thou hast doth match to these bones."
"I accept thine offer!"
My fingers they bleed.
"Thou must find them, Hero! And then never let them leave thy side..."
"Nice man. He made the shoes for mine horses."
You are greeted with a stern look on this man's face.
"'Tis too bad he is dead. I have heard many compliment his abilities as a leader at the mines."
"The chief always keeps the prize artifacts for himself. But he must lock them away in a safe place, or his followers will steal them!"
You see a young woman with a bright smile.
"Jorvin is dead! My love, mine heart's true desire!"
"Welcome again, Hero from Another World! Thy destiny hath again brought thee to the place of Xenka's wisdom!"
"Excellent. Thou hast served me well, pawn. Alas, I shall kill thee just the same."
"How can I explain Xenka in the short time we have? Xenka is the prophetess who receives wisdom from beyond the Void..."
"I am Shriash. Though I am only a little girl, thou must know that I am a faithful follower of Chaos."
"That is most gracious of thee! Yes, this is my shield which so strangely disappeared during that storm!"
"Ophidians are those who follow the Teachings of the Serpents."
"To buy which spell?"
"Hmmm. Perhaps we have misinterpreted the passage."
"You are greeted."
"How canst thou have the key to saving Sprellic's life in thine hand and do nothing as he faces certain death?!"
"Very well. What shall we discuss next?"
The woman you see in front of you has a concerned expression on her face, as if her thoughts were far away.
"A blue egg... have I ever read of such a thing? Blue hens, blue frogs -- but eggs?"
"I cannot allow thee to enter until thou dost tell me the password. Canst thou tell me what the password is?"
"Hello, dear. Art thou sure thou dost not want to speak with Roberto?"
"Glenno at thy service!"
"If thou wilt vouch for thy friend's future behavior, then I shall let him go free."
"Thou dost not have enough guilders for that!"
"I am the bartender here in Moonglow."
"Thou didst agree! I had not thought that thou wouldst go back on thy word!"
"What dost thou care to exchange for monetari?"
"Alas, Xenka's writings follow no order and are convoluted and vague."
"I am Thurston."
"He hath been very cheerful as of late..."
"As thou dost wish."
"For the Pikemen maintain guard towers all along the roads on the mainland. So they are much more widely respected than the Rangers."
"If thou wilt not tell me thy name and business, thou canst not enter the city. Come back when thou art feeling more talkative."
"I ordered him jailed. We are very strict here in Monitor."
"The item sounds as if it might be a piece of magical apparatus. Master Ducio would know for certain."
"Thine unconvincing performance gave thy game away! Thou dost not have ten gold pieces!"
"Could ye unlock this door and let me go?"
"Good price. Good wine."
You see an old man whose domineering disposition matches the hardened physique of his aged body.
"It must have come directly from the northern forests, on the mainland north of the Swamp of Gorlab."
"Unlike the silent novices that thou dost see among us, Thoxa and I have both forged gateways into the power of the Void."
"Slippers? No Mundane could afford them, but perhaps a Mage is missing a pair."
"Dost thou desire another purchase?"
"But I can make time for thee, if thou dost wish to commission my talents."
"And to think she was once a young and beautiful sorceress, before her ambitions turned her cold and heartless..."
"What wouldst thou like to buy?"
A crude brush.
"Alyssand hath never been so busy, nor so burdened with cares. She doth work to exhaustion, yet I think she is happy."
"He has an eye like a hawk, and is quicker than a cat. 'Twould be wise of thee to pay him respect."
"The MageLord must be an Adept, and rules all Moonshade."
"An unfortunate decision, my friend."
"We mourn with thee, Hero From Another World, for this purposeless death of the girl once known as Cantra."
"Thou mayest find them throughout the land. They are of little interest... not Beautiful at all."
"'Tis due to mine injuries. Milk is all that I can tolerate. Boiled milk."
"It is clearly an unacceptable piece of inferior quality. It looks like it may have come from one of the lesser artisans in Moonshade."
"Why, I am Jaana. Thou shouldst remember me!"
"In which circle art thou interested?"
"I could die to be taken into thy brawny arms!"
"Yeah, stupid question."
"Thou art already as proficient as I. Thou mightest consider consulting one of the other trainers that specialize in other areas."
"To train others in Terfin to be strong and powerful. To sell some weapons, also."
"Thou art mad!"
"The Oracle was commissioned by Lady Fawn, many years ago, as an instrument to speak the heavens' truths."
"I told thee my name is Nell."
"What objection hast thou of this tale?"
"Thou dost already have that spell!"
"I suppose it would be too much to hope that it was for me..."
"I am the Trinsic shipwright. If thou wouldst like to know about a ship or a sextant, just say so."
"I may be a drunk, but I be an honest drunk. I shall follow no hypocrite ta a watery grave."
"I am Gilberto."
"As thou dost wish..."
"Very well. Shmed will ask thee the password. Tell him this --"
"Usually on the election of a new Council member, or a new MageLord."
"In which circle art thou interested?"
"As thou wishest..."
"To be interested in which circle?"
"Excellent."
"Moreover, she hath paid for her treachery in blood. She is slain."
"Why, after last accompanying thee on thine adventures I settled down to the peaceful life of a shepherd in New Magincia."
"Thou cannot carry that much!"
You startle a fighter who seems lost in thought.
"Excellent, then."
You see a working-class elderly woman who exudes sweetness.
"To exchange coins, I ask for a small percentage of the money bartered. Dost thou agree to this charge?"
"The head there is Brion. He is the twin of the head of the Lycaeum. I like him, although he and his brother are both a little eccentric."
"Bring to me the Dream Crystal from Rabindrinath's keep and we shall at last be free!"
"There are many who say that Argus took bribes to look aside while illegal activities took place."
"Relax, friend, thou wilt hear when the time is right."
"And a fine champion thou dost make, as well. A true pride to the Wolf Command."
"Why, only the other day one attacked Blorn. G'won, ask him about it."
"I have many items in my possession which may aid thee in thy journeys. Wouldst thou like them?"
"Her name was Gwenno. She left here for the east, anxious to learn the wisdom of the Xenkan Monks."
"I run a small farm here in Paws with my son, Tobias. I am a widow."
"Pray tell me their names that I might relay them to her Ladyship at once."
"Do not get thine hopes up yet, my dear Daphne! I have put a condition on our marriage and poor Cosmo will never be able to fulfill it!"
"They won't bother thee if thou dost not bother them."
"According to Erstam's book, how many spells are available in the Ninth Circle of Magic?"
"aside from myself, of course."
"Every Mage prefers something different from the others. This isn't one I'm familiar with, but I'm not that well-connected."
"A respectable weapon that is. Leaves quite a mess, though."
"Thou dost disappoint me. I had hoped that thou wouldst be more receptive..."
"Her husband is currently in Britain somewhere. I do not know the details. She has a small child."
"There is a thief in this town! Silver serpent venom was stolen from Morfin, the merchant who operates the slaughterhouse."
"Thou cannot sell me what thou dost not have! Now, truly...!"
"They seem to be trapped here as well."
"Thou must first lighten thy load. Then I can give thee some delicious carrots."
"Hast thou brought this object with thee?"
"With the Great Earth Serpent lost, and the Chaos Serpent struck down, only the Order Serpent remains to rule in the Void."
"A Ranger is in service to the MageLord and the Council. 'Tis our duty to guard the city and keep order..."
"Thou'rt not here to sleep, Avatar."
"Why, yes, I see thou art a member too."
"Now, Gustacio hath thrown himself into his studies of the phenomenon of the teleport storms. It hath become his obsession."
"My father works for The Fellowship helping the poor people in Paws. He tries to recruit them, but most refuse."
"Voldin served Fawn as a member of the city guard in his younger days. Before he became a council member, he was a fishing captain."
"Here, I have met thy request to thy precise specifications."
"Thou canst ask about the entire matter at the pub if thou dost wish to know more about it."
"Dost thou not feel the sudden chill in this Temple, at the very mention of Beast British?"
"The Oracle is an instrument of the heavens. Its words are divine revelations to those who follow Beauty's truth."
"Thou shouldst not travel so heavily burdened -- I do not think that thou canst bear the bottles that thou desirest!"
"Very well. Keep thine eye on him. We do not want people popping in and out of our city as he did!"
"Avatar! How good it is to see thee! How long hath it been since we last met?"
"But thou wilt accept mine offer yet..."
"He is the armourer. His shop is in the back of the Hold."
"Voldin doth have a history of service to Fawn. He was unanimously nominated for the council position by his fellow captains."
"Hmmm... If thou dost hold thy weapon higher, thou wilt have better leverage with which to smash thy foes."
"Since the death of Astrid, some say that there is a traitor amongst us -- selling our secrets to the Goblins."
"By careful reasoning then, thou art a new Mage!"
"The owner keeps the shop well-stocked with all of the most useful goods."
"Wouldst thou care for more?"
"I suppose thou dost wish me to operate the gate?"
"What wouldst thou like to buy?"
"The Ashes of the Dead are kept in the mountain caves, where wild beasts cannot defile the urns."
"Oops. Thou art carrying too much. Ask me again when thou dost not have thine hands full!"
"Thou dost not have enough gold for that," he says, shaking his head.~~"Too many birds in the hand is worth a bush."
"'Tis a thing of power from the people who settled this land after the village of Gorlab existed. It is to be thy reward."
"I do not know what it will do... I only know that it was part of a set of such jewelry. And it was a symbol of authority of some sort."
"Recently, our town has been plagued by a thief."
"So, brave warrior come to kill King Goblin? Ha! We speak first..."
"I do not know who thou art, but I am glad thou hast come! At last, I can speak the Truth."
Let us all rejoice in one night of revelry! After the midnight revels and before the end of the night, a new dawn will rise...
"...Until one of the Mages manages to destroy a section of town with his experiments. Then things become lively."
"I have an assortment of very lethal weapons to show thee."
"But that -is- my name! Kissme! Kissme! It is true!"
"How many wouldst thou like?"
"But, 'tis my job... cleaning after the Mages."
"Thou knowest the kind of beauty that artisans create? 'Tis like unto Frigidazzi -- like a cold marble carving."
"Do not toy with mine expectations -- hast thou reconsidered?"
"I shall remember this outrage!"
"Secondly, thou shouldst always carry through with thy swing, as it will improve thy chances of recovering to land succeeding blows."
"Remember, we shall be keeping an eye upon thee!"
"What reagent wouldst thou like to buy?"
"Use the key to obtain the waters of Logic. Thou hast well earned that honor."
"Well, if thou dost decide that my services are needed, I am always here."
"A moment, a moment... It will take me a moment. His writing is terrible!"
"I know dat Brom is somevhere down in dis cave, und I vill not leave dis place until I find him!"
"I did give thee the Crime Certificate already!"
"Hello, little fighter! Step on any ants today?"
"How many wouldst thou like?"
"Thou art already as proficient as I. Thou mightest consider consulting one of the other trainers that specialize in other areas."
You see a lithe-looking fighter smile in your direction.
I have nothing but the highest regard for the Destroyer of the Age of Darkness and Harbinger of the Age of Enlightenment.
"I am Yenani, mate of Myauri, mother of Neyobi and Kapyundi, leader of Gwani people and teller of Gwani history."
"Thou knowest?!"
"Perhaps thou wouldst care to learn another spell?"
"Why... I..."
"I have not the time for these petty geography questions. Check an atlas!"
"I carry water from the well of humility to all of the homes here in New Magincia."
"We are Chaos -- it is our belief, and we are its adherents. We are followers of the Red Serpent."
"He's a fine one to talk of attitude..."
"Cease and desist immediately!"~~"Dost thou wish to avoid the unpleasantries of a lengthy trial?"
"Their names were Battles and Leavell. Both of them treated me like proper gentlemen."
"Hmmm. Any leads on finding this villain?"
"I perform heroic deeds in honor ov Brom. Everyting I do is in service to him."
"Our village near. Speak to Yenani."
"Come, let us toast our friendship and hope for a speedy end to this journey!"
You see a grumpy fellow with a bloody bandage on his head.
"Hmmm-- it seems to me thou dost have a tab still going here? Yes?"
"Oh, well. I thank thee for thy concern."
"Hast thou discovered the reason for Zelda's moods?"
"Very good."
"Congratulations on successfully completing the Knight's Test."
"Thou hast not room to carry even such a small thing as this! If thou wilt set something down, I will give thee the locket."
"Since The Fellowship troublemakers were so disagreeable in our earlier meeting, they have been excluded from this session of the trial."
"I will not detain thee from thy duty overlong, commander."
"The tides are in convergence. If thou desirest Mandrake Roots, thou must hasten to the swamplands."
"I have not had many dealings with him."
"Delphynia is all we have now."
"One of the Adepts serves as MageLord. Currently, Filbercio rules as Lord of Moonshade."
"The Mages of Moonshade are but mere children playing at the arts they have not the patience to learn."
"So they did not seem to have a true appreciation of Beauty?"
"To be called Betra. To be one of two shopkeepers. To say the other is Sarpling."
"Just as the Crown Jewel left I saw a man with a hook jump on board. There was a gargoyle accompanying him."
"The writings are clear: the Hero shall come in the last days, with Three Companions, to battle against the Evil which is in the land."
"Then I shall rule as I always deserved, as King of Fawn!"
"I expected as much. Thou art truly an honorable warrior."
"Here, have some. It good."
"Templar is the expert on the Goblins. Thou mightest consider seeking his advice, before risking thy life."
"The least that I have heard of is blackmail... Who knows to what other means Filbercio will stoop to fulfill his lusts?"
The wide-eyed expression of this youth seems indicative of his naivete.
"Snigger not at me! I have company enough -- more guests in mine house than thou couldst have in thine."
"Master Flindo is a merchant of some sort, I think." ~"He is not very nice."
"If not for Rutherford's fine ale, there would no purpose to the existence of civilization."
"I do not know if Xenka's visions were full of diverse images or if she couched them in such terms out of peevishness."
"Actually, when Luther doth go on the hunt he rarely catches anything!"
"Quite disruptive... They have totally depleted our fishing fleet."
"This solid brass bookstand has matching, overhanging candleholder for late-night exploration in literature. I invented it myself."
"No one else finds it humorous either. I will continue practicing to be funny."
"How many pairs of leather gloves wouldst thou care to sell?"
"How many of these mystics were liars?"
"I have always been called Spark."
"Thou canst just call me... Wench."
"Deadeye liked to provoke a fight and dare the other man to hit him. No one would, for fear of that eye."
"To be a shame. To be taking the news to Teregus of his youngling. To be wondering why we had not heard from Inamo recently."
"'Tis gratifying to see that I shant have to collect thy skull yet. Such stamina shall be useful to thee here, certainly."
"Please make up thy mind!"
"Now that's truly touchin', Olon. Thou surely hast brought a tear ta mine eye, thou hast."
"Nothing is safe... Not even life. I lost my dear Elissia after childbirth..."
"Thou art too encumbered!"
"I am Surok, the Healer of Serpent's Fang and I didst heal thee of thy wounds."
"the Staff, Armour, and Crown of the Great Earth Serpent."
"Thou hast a bargaining tongue, my friend. It reminds me of when I was thine age..."
"I am the Mayor of Trinsic and have been since I arrived here three years ago."
"Poor Avatar... poor, poor Avatar..."
"Whom dost thou suspect of this terrible crime?"
"I must be spending too much time speaking with the dead. I cannot believe that I am agreeing to this!"
"I'm Lucy!"
"Seek out Lydia, and have her give thee the Tattoo of the Knight. Take none of her lip, mind!"
"The key will allow thee to open the gate to the Treasury Room. The armour that I did promise thee is stored there."
"The power of the Helm cannot be understated! With it, Pomdirgun can once again assemble the Goblin Horde, and invade the lands of Men."
"To thank you, Sir!"
"He hath destroyed the lives of many." ~"He doth deserve to be tortured for all the ill that he hath done."
"Please make up thy mind!"
"I needs must touch the scroll to glean its meaning. Else I'll not be able to help thee in this matter."
"Thou dost not have enough gold for that!"
You see a naked man who looks a bit wild. He is not in the least concerned that he has on no clothes.
"The drink of hard-workin' men! A drink ta put hair on thy chest and make the women throw themselves at thee." *"Thou shouldst try it."
"Perhaps later, when thou art more relaxed, eh?"
"Perhaps thou shouldst consider taking the Test of Knighthood. It is not so difficult, with proper training."
You see an alert and no-nonsense guard.
"Say, thou be not from around here?" He looks at you skeptically. "Thou art not from the Fellowship by any chance, art thou?"
"I know about these people:"
"There must be some mistake!"
"Good game live also in the forest: Foxes and the like."
"The patrol was betrayed. And who could have known the plans? Why, another Bear, of course!"
"Wouldst thou like something else?"
"I have not seen Elizabeth and Abraham for many days now."
"Avatar, let us proceed. Cease this dallying!"
"What dost thou wish?"
"Jergi is mine husband, ov course. Now he has the veight ov guiding the gypsy race in these troubled times."
We say, dearest reader, that Logic deals with two states in the Land of Thought: true and false.
"I'm sorry, but that is not the correct answer."
"My name is Shmed. I am a Knight of Monitor, at thy service..."
"Enjoy thy purchase!"
"It was used at the Serpent gates, but we know not what it does."
"I am glad that miserable traitor is no longer Lord of Monitor!"
"It would be my pleasure to act on the Lady's behalf."
"Through his efforts, we escaped, and I used the last of my magic to escape. We found ourselves here -- on the Serpent Isle."
"Thou cannot take thine apple! Thou art carrying too much!"
"Nonsense! That man is an honest and an upright Mage, though he doth have unsettling habits..."
"I am feeling generous today... Thou art lucky!"
"Thou art not a Mage, so teaching thee spells would be a waste of both our times."
"If thou wouldst ever change thy mind, or find thyself in need of a companion, I would be most honored if thou wouldst consider me."
"I have little enough business these days. I shall have to accept."
"To be a digger in the mines. To be looking for iron ore and lead and..."
"I do not know the man too well. I have no dealings with him."
"Dost thou wish to purchase anything else?"
"Thou dost truly believe me now... ah, I see that thou dost. Thou art truly one I can say is my friend."
"It is terrible! The gypsies Frederico and Tania have been found murdered in William's sawmill!"
"So Garritt was the culprit, eh? I am not surprised now that I think about it. I must keep closer tabs on my venom from now on."
"I shall cherish it always, Iolo."
"The only thing a lowly Mundane can hope for is to be able to afford an automaton from Torrissio, to help with the work load."
"I would give thee thy deed but thou art carrying too much to take it from me!"
"Why hast thou disturbed my slumber?"
"Thou art already as talented as I! Thou hast no need of my services!"
"Rocco could tell thee more, for he came to know her rather... well. I only know her name: Gwenno. She left here a few weeks ago."
"Theron was a worker here. Mistress Devra took him in and gave him work and a place to stay. He was not very bright..."
"Thou hast not the amount of gold thou dost want to bet! Art thou trying to swindle me?"
"And thou mayest find that some of the mages are very reclusive and will not speak to thee without proper introduction."
"If thou changest thy mind, thou hast but to return and ask again."
"I know thee for what thou art, stranger! And I shall testify at the trial."
"As thou hast recovered it, that right naturally has fallen to thee."
"Hmmm... sounds malformed. No one in the City of Beauty would use such a brush."
"Thou dost not know the password. The Mayor can give thee the proper password."
"To know little about the former inhabitants, but to believe that they were not Evil. To have visited their sacred places amid the ruins."
"I used to have my shop in Paws. But no one in Paws has the money to buy much of anything."
"Why, I should rip thine head off and feed it to the pigs!"
"He be mighty partic'lar about things like that in his inn."
"He is our town advisor. Very wise man that Eldroth. He also sells provisions."
"Lady Yelinda, wouldst thou please call once again upon the Oracle, for its decision?"
"She be a wise lady. Always concerned with what the people think -- Always listens ta any advice offered."
"But I should not be speaking with thee until thou dost become a Knight of Monitor. Speak with Marsten about that."
"She's quite competent, but not overly warm. I've actually seen her rebuff the MageLord's advances... A formidable woman, indeed."
"I am a monk of the Brotherhood of the Rose. I study geography and nature with a brother named Taylor."
"In which circle art thou interested?"
"Wilt thou tell my parents?"
"Now I've got no husband, but I do have my slippers..."
"Why art thou carrying a dead person with thee? Was it someone kin to thee?"
"But the shop's owner is a stern man, and very strict."
"The Statue of Beauty only speaks at certain times, such as during the spring festivals or when the city needs special guidance."
"Talk is free, too. But I'm a busy man."
"My name is still Trellek."
"I will give him mine!"
"Avatar! They must have been abandoned in here! Why, they must be brother and sister!"
"I have amused thee so far! Wouldst thou like to hear another? It is a joke about gold!"
"The Capessi Canton is Bucia's shop. Well, at least I know that she runs it, whether or not she owns it."
"A File Leader oversees four hands of warriors, and reports to the Senior File Leader."
"The Magister is a storehouse of knowledge. Perhaps he could aid thee."
"Bless thee! I shall be waiting here for thee."
You see a young peasant with a tray of wine glasses.
"This is not honorable! I do not have time to play games with thee! Begone!"
"Well, I am certainly not guilty of such an act!"
"The tribe of humans known as the Ophidians wage war upon one another. I do not know much about these humans."
"Why, that is wine from the Rangers' winery! Their magical winepress always leaves a distinctive flavor... Quite a tingle!"
"There does seem to be a cure, however."
"'Tis about time thou didst ask again!"
"Alyssand weaves them right here in Fawn."
"You give me food?" His face displays a mixture of surprise and hope. "You give me food, I tell you secret. Yes?"
"Thou shouldst do well not to waste my time so in the future! I am an important man!"
Batlin's eyes narrow to red slits as he peers practically through you.
"He is a shrewd and stern ruler. A highly skilled mage. He is not someone thou wouldst want to cross."
"To be able to heal, cure poison, and resurrect. To be interested in one of these services?"
"They are the pride of our city. The Chief Ranger, Julia, hath no mercy for troublemakers."
"Breath doth return to the body. Thy comrade is alive!"
"Pothos is the Apothecary here in Moonshade. He will be able to tell thee all about anything that thou wouldst need to cast magic."
"If events should change thy mind, contact me."
"She is terrible to her enemies, but tolerant of those who aid her."
I believe in the Forces and Powers of Chaos.
"Unlike the unenlightened Mages of Moonshade, our powers come not from moldering reagents."
"Avatar! This bottle is identical to the one from which thou didst drink at the inn in Monitor!"
"My father says that the poor people reject The Fellowship because the Triad of Inner Strength requires strength of character."
"To be well?"
"Along with Battles, I am a bodyguard for Master Robin. If not for him, I would have landed in prison instead of in New Magincia."
"Greetings to thee, Sir Dupre. Art thou back again for thy study of wines for Brommer?"
"Of course everyone is up in arms about this business concerning the missing venom."
"That foul imposter! I spit upon all goblins!"
"I needs must be in thy hand, master, if thou wishest to use my powers."
She stares at you suspiciously.
"Hast thou spoken with my twin, Nelson? He heads the Lycaeum. Or Elad? And surely thou knowest about the mage, Penumbra."
"I would be most distraught to know that thou wert going to endanger thyself."
"I will not speak of that now, but suffice it to say that she who looks like me deep inside hath taken from me all that should be mine!"
"Yes, thou art in Serpent's Hold, home to many noble and valiant knights."
"As long as the Hourglass of Fate is with thee, if thou art killed, thou shalt be resurrected on Monk Isle."
"Fair enough, if I do say so myself."
I still cannot believe that I am the one chosen to be his servant. What a blessing it is...
"'Tis said that he hath some strange compelling power over women..."
"I shall see thee at the inn!"
"Couldst thou please make a decision!?"
"The traditional meal of the banquet is a stew made from the meat of the animal thou didst slay."
"My fee is 30 gold for a training session. Is this all right?"
"Surely thou canst find the farm. It is just north of the shelter."
"He doth live in his memories and stare out to sea. I think he cannot stop yearning to return to sea long enough to be of much help."
"She is a fantastic worker. Better than most men I have mined with."
"I am Mack."
"The only way to go there is by ship, but there are no sailors here -- the storms have discouraged them."
"Thou dost look a bit like a bold pirate with that jaunty mark."
"Thou dost mean Iolo and Dupre, I presume?"
"Go about thy business, and the MageLord shall certainly summon thee when he is ready."
"I am sorry, I do not join thieves."
"I will say only that spells of great destruction require that vile compound. I will tell thee no more..."
Must survive the perils of Freedom...
A finely crafted ring, of silver, of a size to fit a small woman or a child.
"My fee will leave thee with nothing!"
"What is thy name?"
"I cannot help but think that thou art connected with our fate. How, I cannot say."
"Well, at least safe, if not necessarily quiet. Especially with all the commotion caused by Owen and his monument."
"I have told him to cease drinking that swill, but he insists. From a healer's point of view, that ale should be banned!"
"Thou art always welcome here, felon... As long as thou dost have money, that is."
"There is also a song about the northern savages. ~Wouldst thou care to hear it?"
"Thou art dredging up ancient history!"
"Search my manor! I have no prisoners there..."
"In what Circle of Magic doth the Create Automata spell appear?"
"It was a member of The Fellowship that has accused mine husband. Now they wish for me to join them."
"I beg of thee, canst thou indulge me for but one song? The sinister thunder doth linger in mine ears."
"If this is the best I can get, I had best take it."
"I must have the Heart of Elerion. Draygan had it, but it belongs to me. If thou canst find it, I shall reward thee."
"Surely thou knowest of whom I speak... For he is the ruler that sent thee to meet thy fate here."
"The body lies in the garden of the Temple of Enthusiasm, in the northeast by the Gate of the Serpent..."
"I have done this one for thee before..." ~"Wouldst thou like to hear it again?"
"And Lord British is no Daemon! He's a good man, and hath often commissioned me to create new maps for him..."
"I must prepare an appropriate welcome for mine old enemy!"
"His name is actually Erstam. But everyone here refers to him as the Mad Mage."
"Gustacio is mightily peeved, I can tell thee. Mortegro was helping him with an experiment, and Gustacio cannot complete his work alone."
"Ha! There was thy spell, foolish woman! Now the stockings are destroyed and they shall trouble me no more!"
"As long as she hath not rejected me out of hand, I will be content to wait. Thy good deed hath given me reason to live!"
"Sorry, but we have too many people in there already."
"And he was none too particular if it was a quick death or not. Anyway, soon his 'research' even upset the Council of Mages."
"An' now, before I let ye go, deary, I'll warn ye again... Do not take anyone inta that there maze wit' ye. No two see this place the same."
"To want what item?"
"Delphynia is a horticulturist." ~"Her knowledge of herbs made her the only logical choice as healer when Seth was killed."
A pretty woman gives you a friendly grin and then coyly turns her eyes away from you.
"Thou hast ruined it all! Die!"
"Mara? She needs to learn how to act like a woman. Her manly attitude doth not fool anyone."
"Perhaps he is right. Perhaps this tale is too rough for thy pretty ears. Dost thou wish me ta tell another tale instead?"
"Welcome, Mage. I am pleased to see thee again."
"Surely this proves Krayg's innocence, for he is not a drinking man."
"Before thou didst slay Rabindrinath, thou hadst seen a small part of the whole..."
"Lady Yelinda be the ruler here in Fawn. She be Fawn's living symbol of Beauty."
Nicholas points to the diapers on the table.
"Thou dost not have enough money to buy a sextant!"
"It is ready."
"What wouldst thou like to buy?"
"Thou wert brought to Britannia for a reason, I surmise. If thou dost not know what it is, shouldst thou not seek it out?"
"Mine husband is imprisoned in Britain for stealing fruit from the Royal Orchards."
"What then," he asks, "is the problem?"
Whereby wood-builders and metal-workers may cross skills without the need for guild officiation limited by the following principles...
"Thou hast seen the changes, I'm sure..."
The skull of a great mountain bear.
"An unfortunate decision, my friend."
"Very good! Let me see how many thou dost have..."
"As thou hast probably guessed by now, my friends started calling me 'Stumpy' because I loved to stump them with my riddles."
"To want to buy how many?"
"Thou dost not have enough money."
"But I, like thee, am a member of The Fellowship. Thou must stand in unity with me for what I tried to do!"
"To be extremely violent." He shakes his head. "To be named Runeb, which means `red mist.' To be all that he leaves of a foe after combat."
"I am Lucky... in all things."
"Yes, how may I help?"
"Do not worry, Avatar! I shall order the Pikemen to place the traitors under arrest!"
"Thou dost lie! Now I must certainly slay thee."
"I have always hated the Beast, and I always shall!"
"I can give thee 1 gold coin for every 2 filari thou hast."
"To be dead now, though."
"Thou dost not know what thou art missing..."
"I am Delin, provisioner of Fawn. In case we have not been introduced."
"Welcome, Mage. I am pleased to see thee again."
"It would be a shame if he were dead, for only he knows the secrets of speaking with the souls of the dead."
"Thy friend was taken by magical means? 'Tis incredible. Thou art new to this town..."
You see a thoroughly disheartened young man who is miserably languishing behind bars.
"Thou art in Balance, having mastered both Chaos and Order. I declare thee worthy to bear the emblems of the Great Hierophant of Balance."
"Ahhhh... Errrr... Well...."
"Order in the court!"
"Why dost thou not stay the night? For but 3 gold thou canst let one of our rooms. Dost thou wish to stay the night?"
"Am I not one of thy dearest friends, Katrina?"
"Not bad..."
"Take the key and enjoy thy freedom!"
"A rather violent place, by all accounts. I have not had the pleasure of a visit in quite a while."
"Do not worry, Avatar! I shall order the Pikemen to place the traitor under arrest!"
"Whatever thou dost say, dear Henry."
"Failure in ContStartOfTournament() because we couldn't find the guard."
You see a woman whose cultured manner is tinged with a suggestion of arrogance.
The two of you rush into each other's arms and your mouths meet. You had forgotten how good her lips felt against yours.
A funerary urn containing the Ashes of the Dead, taken from the Caves of Monitor.
"Here are thy boots then... And I thank thee for my slippers."
You see the meanest, toughest-looking guard you have ever seen in Britannia.
"What spell dost thou wish to learn?"
"The Guardian said that he hath grown tired of the game here on Serpent Isle. The end is inevitable now..."
"The Council is composed of Adepts that balance the MageLord's power. They represent the voice of the Mages within the city."
"British was his name. Lord British, he called himself. But we call him Beast British!"
"Thou canst not have failed to notice that I am an automaton. Torrissio is my maker... Curse his black heart!"
"I am not daft, sorceress. I can see very well what hath been happening here."
He turns to his right and speaks to no one.
"They seem to worship the powers of Order and Chaos."
"I still have some of thy worthless belongings. If thou wantest them, thou hadst best take them now."
"The Mages of Moonshade claim that it would be dangerous for magically-gifted children to grow up without proper training."
"Thou hast not heard Leon speak? Oh, thou shouldst!"
"I was right! Thou art a brave lad! I'll tell thee a fine love story next. Now where was I?"
"Our friend Iolo shares thy grief, milord. His wife is lost somewhere in these lands."
"Through these ancient items, the Power shall communicate with thee. More than this, I know not."
"And I'm afraid that she thinks all strangers are in league with Batlin. Of course, it did not help that he had that Daemon, either..."
"We have just opened a special section in which thou might be interested -- an exhibit of 'Avatar artifacts'!"
"Is the price acceptable?"
"Why, what else wouldst thou call it? Surely thou art truly humbled by my `majestic' presence."
"They brought thee here along their way to Vesper."
"To be the word for `small valor.'"
"Oh... this is so embarrassing!"
"Art thou daft? I said that I have never met the man. I can form no opinion."
"I must stay awake..."
"It doth not take much more than a glance at their commander to see what a worthless Command they are."
"Wouldst thou like to know about the townsfolk of Skara Brae?"
"Then he must remain in his cell."
"He is the greatest ruler this land has ever known and I am proud to serve him."
"But please tell me what brings thee here!"
"Then perhaps thou shouldst have another."
"I can give thee 1 monetari for every 4 filari thou hast."
"Dost thou know that, without the possibility of escape by ship because of the storms, I had actually feared that the city might be lost?"
"Excellent! Dost thou have some eggs for me?"
"The Britannian Mining Company has asked us to dig a tunnel to New Magincia! It will revolutionize the mining industry."
"Of course most of the food he left was uneaten! I had to give it away once it started to spoil!"
"As Renfry can tell thee, we Monitorians have a special reverence for the Ashes of the Dead."
"I am dreadfully sorry," he sniffs, "but thou dost not have enough gold."
"He is not, I fear, a good advisor when it comes to political matters. In fact, Zulith would be better in that respect."
"He went west into the woods, to be alone."
"Which coin dost thou care to exchange for filari?"
"I think Hawk's reluctance to sail lies more at the bottom of an empty mug and an empty coffer..."
"I have no job. I have a quest. My quest is shared with mine half-sister, Amanda."
"I must be going slack-witted, ta offer thee a price like this!"
"Yurel loves cheese..."
The large ghost continues to work, but now he whistles a sweet, sad tune as he hammers on the iron bars of the cage.
"What else wouldst thou call a man who hacks his assistants to pieces for his experiments?!"
"Though I doubt one such as thee would attempt to deceive me, many 'followers' of late do not appear to truly be devoted to Order."
"Quite sad, actually. I recall that the morning I went to her to report the theft, she was terribly upset."
"Dost thou think that thou canst chain the Serpent of Order within a prison of Balance? Never! Servants of Order, attack!"
"I am the clerk for the Moonglow branch of The Fellowship."
"Thou art the Hero from Another World. It is for thee that she doth return. We must hurry!"
"I cannot explain how it was that I got there, or even that it is not empty..."
"Ah, lovely woman. 'Tis a pity she is more interested in politics than the stage. But I must say that we get along famously!"
"People like to see tales of heroic adventures, knights in armour, beautiful princesses, wise kings, wizards, evil monsters. All that rot."
"Dost thou want such items returned?"
"And the fine could be as insignificant as a verbal upbraiding, or as serious as thy life."
"I am amazed! Thou art already as experienced as I! Thou cannot be trained further by me."
"Follow the Serpent Road north and thou shalt come to it. But thou mayest not return."
"Mama and me live in cave since babies."
"Thou dost not have enough monetari to purchase this..."
"Quickly, let us find Iolo. He can tell thee all about the discovery!"
"Then thou must look elsewhere for that service."
The gem sparkles up at you, "Yes, master. How may I serve thee?" Arcadion's voice is subdued.
"They told me I'd be here for the rest of my life. I have no reason to doubt them either!"
"I am the caretaker of the Royal Orchards here in Britain."
"I am sorry, I do not join thieves."
"Tis my nickname. Perhaps when I know thee better, I shall tell thee the reason I was given this nickname..."
You notice the music box he spoke of sitting nearby.
"But I must not speak of these things to a stranger. Thou couldst be a spy for them..."
"Thou dost dare to speak that name in my presence, thou cretin?! I said I do not want to hear that name come from thy lips ever again!"
"I am the Innkeeper at the Out'n'Inn."
"It was commissioned by Lady Fawn herself, and built by the Mages of Britannia."
"My name is Cynthia."
"I am certain that thy business is far more urgent."
"'Tis a simple matter, when thou dost know the secret..."
"Dost thou accuse me?"
"Iolo should be in our party adventuring with us."
"I told thee I was not a looney! Didst thou see the proof?"
"As thou hast seen, the ashes are used in the climax of the Test of Knighthood. Somehow, they have the power to summon one's totem animal."
He points to the gargoyle.
"There are four of us here, doomed to perform the same lines over and over 'til eternity dawns."
"I am not the first to have worked as the Master's assistant. Nor, I fear, shall I be the last. There have been many of us."
"Why, now that I mention it, he was dressed a lot like thou art. Yes, he was."
"Kylista is the worst example of this pernicious doctrine of Beauty..."
"To be impossible for Runeb to be responsible." He smiles kindly. "To be a practical joke."
"Enough talk! Back to work!"
"A unicorn is one of a family of nature spirits that were once called upon to aid a very powerful wizard many, many years ago."
"I will accept thine offer. But I shall deny it to my dying day... I have a reputation to uphold, thou knowest."
"To goblins, who are vile, ugly monsters, Beauty is a lie. To Pomdirgun, Beauty is something to be exterminated, not cherished."
"I have also heard that, like all cats, they are a sneaky, conniving lot."
"I would be thine humble servant shouldst thou help investigate the matter. Wilt thou?"
"Is the price acceptable?"
"Someone told us his name. Let me see if I can remember it... Sullivan, I think it was. Funny name for an Avatar, but there thou art!"
"I am a Knight of Monitor, and a member of the Command of the Bear. I also serve Lord Marsten as his tactical adviser."
Be humble. Talk no more so very proudly, let not arrogance flow from thy mouth like wisdom from the fountains of Spinebreaker.
"Ale is what Kane calls that parrot of his..."
"Question me! I am ready. On what subject dost thou desire information?"
"I can explain the rules and how to play for thee. I also make sure that one does not cheat."
"Now that's something we like! How much dost thou have?"
You see a pleasant-looking young peasant woman.
"No cheating, stranger!"
"Thou cannot say 'bye' to us! How rude!"
"They are hard pressed, what with the Goblins and all."
"Sounds like a big pinecone!"
"Cease and desist immediately, ruffian!"
The gargoyle standing before you has a sour expression on his face.
The troll snarls at you, obviously displeased at your presence.
"Avatar! I cannot believe thy words!"
"Friendly fellow -- I like him."
"I am a member of our local Artist's Guild here in Minoc."
"To delay no longer."
"Any Mage can study here in safety, knowing that this place is a sanctuary from violence."
"Morfin is a clever and industrious member of The Fellowship. He runs the local slaughterhouse and is also a snake venom merchant."
"Batlin, I think his name was. Poked around Moonshade for quite a while, asking questions and buying spells."
A fine pair of sheer stockings, probably women's attire.
"Yes, I am a member. Wouldst thou like to join?"
"Dear Iolo, our subjects have spoken of that fine ballad which thou didst sing, and thy devotion to thy lost wife hath touched our heart."
"My daughter Cantra is missing! I know she would never run away from me, but I feel certain that the Goblins did not take her."
"'Tis not my job to know them. 'Tis for the Council of Mages to enforce."
"How many bottles wouldst thou like?"
"He was a very great man. His name was Vasculio."
"Come to the winery when we are open and thou canst sample our wares then!"
"Then there's Joth, an old sea-farin' man and a good customer of mine. But since he was hurt in the storms, he hath been a bit gruff."
You face the boy and tell him who you are.
"Oh, we sell all manner of things. Cloaks, swords..."
"Between thou and me, she is too young for that husband of hers. If I were her, I'd die!"
"I cannot charge a master such as thyself full price."
"He possesses the grim silence of the professional executioner. Shamino never laughs. I find him to be disquieting..."
"Thou dost have what will free us... If thou wilt help us, I shall reward thee with the Serpent Necklace."
"Careful with what thou wouldst put near the thing! It hath the capacity to destroy practically any object in the world!"
"We shall now hear the evidence against the traitor."
"Then do not return unless thou hast had a change of heart! I am saddened beyond bearing!"
"These? They are for the prisoner's cells, witless knave!"
"There is no antidote, so thou canst look forward to a long and painful death!"
"Gold and lead."
"Well, I certainly do not intend to go along with this at all!"
"Wouldst thou like something else?"
"I will accept only guilders in exchange for teaching thee spells."
"Please bear with me, Zulith. This is for the good of Fawn."
"We have lost most of our men to the sea and storms." ~"We do not know if they were drowned or transformed."
"Then thy thirst will not be quenched here."
"Even as was foretold! I have travelled a great distance to meet with thee. My name is Thoxa."
"I am sorry, but I prefer not to gossip."
"Why, the hearts of Ice Worms, of course! Kill an Ice Worm, strip it of its heart, and kill another."
"We must press on, Avatar!"
He hands you the helmets.
"Thou shalt not live to regret this. Open thy mind to me!"
"Dost thou accept?"
"My beloved husband was slain while doing his duty, so I should have no complaints. Though Goblins have taken his life, they too shall die."
"Here is a serpent's tooth. This will allow thee to travel back from whence thou didst come."
"One of them is named D'Rel. E's a pirate, from Buccaneer's Den."
"'Tis actually quite easy. Do not believe what the Knights will tell thee. Frankly, if I can pass it, anyone can!"
Slowly, the sword settles into its original shape, except for the blue gem glowing in the hilt.
"Thou shouldst report such a crime as this to Julia. She can aid thee."
"But thou dost not have enough gold! Perhaps thou shouldst visit the House of Games and increase the bulges in thy pockets!"
"No one could possibly carry that much!"
"Aye, Mosh..."
"Doth natural lightning do aught but kill? Doth normal lightning transport an item thousands of leagues from where once it stood?"
"It is an ancient piece of armour that was found near the Serpent ruin around which the palace is built."
"Which of you dost wish to train?"
"It saddens me to speak the Truth to thee, stranger."
"Thou shouldst try some. The monks have been making it for more than three hundred years!"
"Return if thou dost reconsider... I doubt that thou canst finish thine own quest without mine aid."
"I know that we have met before, Stranger. Dost thou not recall?"
"Hast thou not heard stories of these creatures? They are terrible, ferocious, savage creatures!"
His eyes widen at the sight of you.
"Thou dost not have enough gold for that!"
"Julia is a rather forbidding woman. Always seems to be looking for thy secret desire to cause trouble, if thou knowest what I mean."
"'Tis rude of thee, father, to discuss such matters in public!"
"The Goblins did not ambush that patrol without help. If Lord Marsten doth not recognize this, then he is blind as well as brainless."
"All others who would venture into the Void have no path to guide them and are doomed to death for their arrogance."
"I can give thee 75 guilders for every gem thou dost have."
"I -- hahaha! -- am the Insanity Bane! Hahaha!"
"So what'rt thou looking at, eh?"
"Thine attitude dost seriously endanger thy freedom. I suggest that thou change it quickly."
"I am one of the best fighters in this town. This is why all of the Knights desire to be trained by me."
"Very good! Let me see how many thou dost have..."
"I shall attempt to become better informed."
"Forgive me. I have no questions for thee."
"The boat left just after sunrise. It did sail to Britain, I believe. Thou canst ask Gargan the Shipwright about that."
He gestures toward your Fellowship medallion. "Thou shouldst not have any problem." He winks and wiggles his eyebrows.
"Thou couldst enquire in Moonshade, to see if any of the Mages are missing any equipment. I am sorry I cannot be of any more help to thee."
She takes the banner from you.
"'Tis thine!"
"If I tell thee this last thing, wilt thou depart so I may return to my job?"
"I warn thee that this place is not safe. It holds unknown perils. Perhaps thou wouldst do better to leave this place."
"As thou dost wish..."
"I cannot tell thee much about them... Not being a Mage and all. Perhaps thou couldst ask a Mage."
Hence, he is stronger as well as more daring.
"I do not know its significance, but we have treasured it ever since... as a sign of Fawn's strength."
"Thou didst leave it when thou didst last visit Britannia. Here it is."
"But thou didst not see him actually perform any vile acts?"
"No one would sell... Who knows, perhaps he hoped to make some sort of deal with my father for them."
"As thou wishest..."
"Thou canst not change thy mind! Thou didst agree!"
"Is thine enemy a Mundane, or a Mage? What dost thou believe?"
"The pain is gone, but only to be replaced by his obsessive anger. The poor fool does not even realize he is dead! He thrives on his anger."
"Then I must continue to seek him."
"Very well. It pleases me that thou art healthy."
"I... I'd rather not say. Please do not ask."
"What? I thought we had an agreement."
On the other hand, carnivorous creatures attack the weakest opponent.
"To assure your companions that no harm shall come to you or to them during the Test. To believe this myself."
"A place where I shall never be seen! I distrust magic in all its forms."
"One more time, then..."
"If thou wilt vouch for thy friend's future behavior, then I shall let him go free."
"How many dost thou want?"
"Used ta rent my sleepin' rooms regularly ta strangers that came through. But we've had only a few visitors since the storms began."
"Of course. What dost thou desire to know?"
"I am sure they would appreciate its return..."
"I can give thee 4 filari for every 1 monetari thou hast."
"Eventually the world will destroy itself... Much like what is happening now."
"Dost thou have the Scroll of Infinity amongst thy possessions?"
"Perhaps we should go find Sir Dupre and have him join us as well."
"Very well, master. If thou cannot dispatch this foe thyself, I shall do it for thee."
"I stole the venom from Morfin so I could put the blame on Tobias."
"And he was responsible for the death of Seth, Fawn's healer."
"Kylista refused us the safety of the city walls, even when the tower fell to the barbaric goblins."
"Such a shield could belong to anyone in Monitor."
"Then perhaps thou wouldst prefer ta hear a tale of a timeless love story that crosses the frozen wastes."
"What a cad! This whoreson thinks to escape punishment for the crime by blaming it all on dear Frigidazzi."
"Here they are."
"Here is thy key."
"Return when thou hast learned how to count!"
"My given name is Wilhelm, although no one calls me that. I prefer to be addressed as Willy. Thank thee very much."
"Playing tag!"
"One did live north of our village. We drove different one east many years ago."
"I thank thee, kind customer. Thou mayest take thy lute. I can see that thou art a true artisan with an appreciation for quality."
"Ah, so Karenna said I was cute, did she? Yes, I have known she has had her sights set on me for years."
"All right, I suppose thou hast learned thy lesson. I shall rejoin."
"Canst thou keep a secret?"
"Thou shouldst really come to a meeting. Thou wouldst learn a lot!"
"Without access to that scroll I can be of no further use to thee. Dost thou not remember what I told thee?"
"Then thou must find the head and put it in the hopper before the experiment can begin."
Shock covers her face.~~"Well," she huffs.
"For thy service to Monitor and to the community of Knights I shall pay thee for thy trouble."
"Then ask of me once more."
"If thou canst not pay, then thou canst leave!"
"To make sure the gargoyle race is heard in the castle. To have been a long road to acceptance and integration into Britannian society."
"How many sets wouldst thou like?"
"Wouldst thou like to see our Passion Play?"
"No, I'd call it an ale tale.. made from the fumes of mine ale!"
"A good deal, if I do say so myself."
"His family has been on Buccaneer's Den for generations. Comes on a trifle too strong with the barking of wares, if thou dost ask me."
"Who might I be addressing?"
"He answered my questions easily, though in truth I cannot remember what I asked of him."
"If thou wishest Fawn ale, it comes only in brown bottles."
"Wouldst thou like something else?"
"Yes, I sell mine healing services to those who need them."
"Britannia -- even thine home, Avatar -- is in deadly peril!"
"Sweet is the sight of a battle axe swinging in the pitch of battle."
The gargoyle seems to be too busy conducting the Fellowship meeting to speak with you now.
"I do not think the Lady to be the mindless, spineless creature which some others do. I think she is a victim of this system."
"I am known in these parts as Roberto."
"Begone from my sight! Thy meddling in my business is unwelcome, stranger!"
"My name is still Arcadion, although my prison has changed."
"Do not even raise this topic -- I have no stomach for the political games which one must play in order to win a seat on the Council."
"My time with thee is short, so take careful heed of mine advice --"
"Thou must find the crystal and gaze into it. Go to mine home. It is there, on the table."
"I am qualified to heal, cure poison, and resurrect. Art thou interested in one of these services?"
"I can give thee 1 monetari for every 3 guilders thou hast."
"His daughter, Alyssand, looks after him these days. She doth make certain that he doth not wander away."
"These are stockings thou mayest find our fisher women wearing. They are made right here, by young Alyssand."
A very neat, well-groomed, kindly man stands before you.
"The Magic Storms have wrecked every boat on this coast except one. That vessel belongs to Captain Hawk."
"However, the magic did not originate with Torrissio --"
"Wonderful people. They hail from Monitor. They keep the roads safe."
"It will be huge and made of the finest ore from our mine."
"I discovered why. Draygan had the ship burned, leaving them all to be eaten by the wolves!"
"By the way, be sure to give thy greetings to Ranger Ernesto..."
"Indeed. The storms have been known to magically displace their victims."
"Wouldst thou like something else?"
"I was not always a beggar. Like Fenn and Merrick, I used to be a farmer, too. But times got worse, and times are always bad in Paws."
The gargoyle stares at you, displeased at the interruption.
"A man with a hook? No, I saw no one all night or all morning."
"Failure in Brendan2Usable(_Path_Failure) because we failed in our pathfind."
"Speak to Lord Marsten, and win my freedom! I know thou shalt not leave me..."
This attractive woman gives you an approving look.
"I shall not become a rich man from customers like thee..."
"I am a blunt, plain-spoken woman, noble Hero. Too plain for those who wanted to feel that they followed the words of some holy sage."
"What business is this of thine? If thou dost wish to train with me, then meet me at the List Field at noon."
"Strange -- 'twas so cold in here when thou didst enter, but now I feel suddenly warm..."
"A bouquet costs 12 gold. Art thou still interested?"
"'Tis a fine price by me!"
"Thou hast thine hands full, idiot!"
"If the shop is open when we arrive there, Boydon will almost certainly be there."
"Thou art carrying too much to take the beef and pastry!"
"What dost thou need now?"
"Perhaps another evening then."
"Maybe when thou dost feel more brave, then."
"Please come visit in the late evening hours when our hosts and hostesses are here!"
"I can give thee a room if thou wilt come to mine inn when I am open!"
"All right, thy time is over!"
"Father, that is my business!"
"A sack will cost thee 12 gold. Art thou interested in purchasing some?"
"Hag, now is it?! Well, we shall see about that, deary!"
"When not tending to Fellowship affairs, I am a jeweller here in Britain. If thou dost wish to buy something, say so!"
"Of course, it will never cost thee anything to use mine healing services."
"Harpies! To battle! Let us slay them at once!"
"His name is Addom. While he is in town, I am letting him stay in one of my beds."
"Thou hast a lot of gall attempting to buy something from my shop without enough gold in thy possession!"
A specimen of laboratory apparatus from a mage's laboratory.
"I hope Cantra can be found. The Goblins must have taken her -- they eat children, as thou knowest."
"What torture chamber? Did I say torture chamber?"
"Free! Free! Free at last!"
"This is proof that Lord Marsten hath been conspiring with the Goblins! That old goat!"
"Wouldst thou like something else?"
Leather armour, boots, collar, gloves and helm offer the least protection. On the other hand, they will be the lightest.
"I have exciting news -- the monks have returned Shamino to us again, healthy and whole! This he can explain to thee."
I believe that believing in Enthusiasm will teach me the source of the energy which will allow me to accomplish great tasks.
"The Temples have been desecrated, and the altars have been thrown down..."
"Thou dost not have enough guilders to purchase this..."
"Now mine heart can sing, at the sight of thee!"
"My name is Miggim. I am the librarian on Monk Isle."
"I am Ruggs, a poor sailor from Britannia. How may I serve thee today?"
"They brought thee here along their way to the Fellowship meditation retreat near Serpent's Hold."
"To have seen by the Dream, that we must entrust this device to the Hero who shall come."
"See how crude the tracery is, and how ill the stones fit? It is clearly an unacceptable piece of inferior quality."
"To be called... blackrock."
"Perhaps I could find another song for thee..."
"Thou canst not be faulted for not knowing their names. No doubt there are quite a number of Pikemen."
"Canst thou not see that this is merely a time of waiting, before our ascension into the Void? So it cannot be called Death."
"Remember to seek out the Three Companions -- they must be at thy side!"
"How many suits of leather armour wouldst thou care to part with?"
The beady-eyed man sneers at you.
"They are indeed the best fish and chips in all of Britannia."
"Jakher told thee he doth find me attractive? He denies it, of course, but I have known for years that he doth have feelings for me."
"Me live with Papa here in cave!"
You see a young, tan, muscular, handsome man who exudes much verve and geniality.
"I am Weston."
"Sadly, thou hast nothing that I desire. I have no need for gold, and thou dost not know any spells which I crave..."
I See men who are not men covered in fur...
Chaos is wrong and hath no place within our philosophy.
"If thou hast business about the town, and are not able to locate John-Paul, thou mightest wish to speak with Sir Richter."
"Wouldst thou be my champion, Avatar?"
"But we had an agreement!"
"Lockpicks work on locked doors, too. Of course, we only use them for virtuous reasons -- the Avatar is no common thief!"
So much to learn from this land, I am overcome with joy. So much to learn about its fauna and flora, I must start early in the morning.
"Yes, of course thou wouldst."
A red hunk of stone.
"This town is a rough place. A fine place for fighting men and women to live. Perhaps thou hast seen our local sport?"
"Many of us have these stones. In fact, it is a tradition for the best Mages to own one or more of them."
"Thou hast thine hands full, idiot!"
"Such offense to Beauty cannot go unpunished... The stain of their presence must be washed away with their blood."
"I am interim Fellowship Branch leader here on Buccaneer's Den. Our regular leader, Abraham, is away on Fellowship business at the moment."
"Ah! 'Tis one of Simon's ale bottles. I order them specially for him, as only he can stand the taste."
"Perhaps when thou hast fewer things to occupy thy pack, I can give this to thee."
"Thou dost not have enough money to pay for it!"
"Thou art alive! Thou hast survived the holocaust! So many are dead..."
"I sell bows and crossbows here at Iolo's South."
"There is certain to be a grave shortage of reagents in that city soon."
"What madness art thou saying, Petra?"
"Milk and cheese and butter are milk-stuffs."
"Why, er, surely thou hast heard of the famous guides compiled for Brommer!"
"Caladin is already deceased!"
"Is there something else thou wouldst like to see?"
"The Guardian spoke to us after thou didst disappear."
"Ah, well. Keep searching. I am positive thou wilt come across some information soon!"
"I accept thine offer!"
"Thou dost not look like those humans who call themselves Ophidians, but I canst smell their spore upon thee."
"Then I have a mission for thee."
"I hope thou dost know that thou art getting a good bargain at this price."
"Do not tell Argus... He'll think his mother hath gone soft in the head for giving thee a price like this."
"My name is insignificant, oh great one. I am but a shadow in thy destiny and the glory of Xenka."
"Attack it with flame! Slime has no defense against it."
"The Lady would welcome thee formally to Fawn. Thou mayest attend her within her throne room at the palace, after noon."
"Who dares to disturb the restless repose of the Hierophant of Chaos!"
"My fee will leave thee with nothing!"
Thou wilt learn how to read a book and how to fight intelligently in our worlds.
"I thank thee for freeing me from this hellhole! The natives of this place are ignorant sots. Imagine, thinking me to be a sorcerer!"
She hands you 50 gold coins.
"I'll tell ye straight on that it'd be easier iffin ye turned an went back to that there keep right now. So do ye want yer hints or not?"
"I shall accept thy kind offer, Forest Master."
"I understand -- everyone is short of coins these days..."
"Well, if thou art so rude to ask..."
"Lord Marsten, there is a traitor in our midst."
"They are the tastiest meats that thou canst buy. Do thyself a favor and try some."
"The Modest Damsel is now closed for business. But do please return during business hours."
"To be also without wings, but to be respected as if he were winged."
"That's a relief. I only had one left."
"I have paid my debt to thee, and our bargain is concluded. I shall not aid thee again. Beware the Banes of Chaos, Avatar!"
"We are locked into this existence, ghosts endlessly reciting the same arguments, as if our doom is somehow tied to the greater cycle."
You see a stunningly attractive oriental woman. She is armed to the teeth.
"Wouldst thou like to buy some clothing today?"
"This laboratory equipment must surely belong to Erstam, the Mad Mage! It bears the unmistakably foul stench of one of his experiments."
"To sell magics and such at his shop."
"Yes, captain. The Serpent Ruins."
"Wouldst thou like to have them back?"
"He is the son ov Frederico and Tania. He left us to learn more about The Fellowship. Ov course, he feels responsible for vhat happened..."
"What do ye mean did Oi 'umpeth Abby. 'Course Oi didn't. Oi never went anywhere near Abby. 'Oo told ye that?"
"Nevertheless -- look everywhere, talk to everyone, see if thou canst find the clue that hath eluded us!"
"Use the key to obtain the waters of Logic. Thou hast well earned that honor."
"No no no! Think again!"
"Well enough! Take this blue key. It will open the gate to the catacombs for thee."
"In my day I was a pretty damned good soldier. Now I am the master of the Armoury here in Jhelom."
"Templar is a Knight of the Bear Command, and my friend."
"Ensorcio is an exiled mage. Who doth know what he did? I am too afraid to ask..."
"There are many places that thou wilt want to visit while thou art here."
"Thou art a dog, to have brutalized an innocent townsperson. Thy place is behind stout iron bars!!!"
"There. 'Tis all I can remember. If thou desirest to know more, thou shouldst speak to a mage."
"Aye... I stood up to dinner that night. I remember."
"It would be so much more simple if Xenka would return and explain these infernal riddles herself! She is worse than Chuckles!"
"Hey ho! It's good to see ye again! Found yer way out of that there maze, huh? Somethin' tricky, weren't it?"
"I swear to thee, it is the Avatar!"
"Halt! Only a true follower of Order may pass this portal. Art thou such a disciple?"
"He met her in Jhelom. She was serving in the Bunk and Stool. Apparently it was `love at first sight,' as he calls it."
"All right, I suppose thou hast learned thy lesson. I shall rejoin."
"Following the Triad of Inner Strength allows one to become attuned to the Inner Voice."
"When our forefathers killed Gurnordir, the Helm was claimed for Monitor. It hath since been worn by the Knight Champion."
"Mother doth do all the cooking here... and she is very good."
"To be called The Fellowship."
"Do not taunt me... with hopes of release. I must perform my duty... until the end of eternity."
"Xenka disappeared quite some time ago. Many think that she will return to deliver the final key to saving our doomed world."
"Would never have guessed that he had the spine to leave like that. But I suppose that every man doth have his breaking point..."
"Master of reagents! Wizard beyond compare!"
"So, thou seest... Thou art brave, intelligent and beautiful. Thou art not one nor the other... Thou art all these things at once."
"Templar is very attractive, I think. But Caladin is a brute, and Luther is a clod!"
"Come back to the pub in the evening to hear our house band, The Avatars!"
"What dost thou desire to know?"
"The wizard... the key is the dead wizard... thou must vanquish him."
"I am Judith. And I already know who thou art!"
"Pray excuse my poor manners, stranger! I am Widow Harnna, the Healer of Monitor. I also sell vegetables from my garden."
"And I thank thee once again for saving my life. I shall never forget thee."
"Zhelkas hath appointed me moderator of the Game, Avatar. He hath also given me leave to explore..." *"Art thou ready to begin?"
"Thou hast not enough guilders for my rooms."
"Whom dost thou wish to train?"
"Ah, er... I can do fine without thee, my dear."
"His words were the Words of Chaos. He communed with the Serpent, and wore his armour upon his breast. He was our Serpent Father."
"We meet again. Thy destiny draws near quickly... How may I be of service to thee?"
The mayor looks at you again as if he were studying every pore on your face. Finally, he smiles.
"What kind of bloody stupid question is that? I am in the prison! What kind of job could I possibly have?"
"However, she was barely literate, and needed others to act as scribes for her convoluted visions."
"I would say that she feels rather strongly about this, Avatar. But what she is proposing to stop the storms seems a bit extreme."
"Go thou and find it. I am certain that it will help thee."
"Timing is essential. The fiery missiles can be outrun, if thou dost watch carefully."
"If thou art fond of thy life I would advise against venturing into Aram-Dol's domain."
"I see thee draw thyself up... Have I offended thee? And what wilt thou do, Pikeman? Drag me to thy jail as thy comrades did drag Hawk?"
"I have something that might interest thee."
"Perhaps another time then..."
"I am the head of the observatory here in Moonglow," he says proudly. "This is where the telescope is kept."
"I shall not forget that thou hast beaten me, vile human!"
"Wouldst thou like something else?"
"Whatever shall we do now?"
"If thou weren't mine only steady customer, Olon, I'd throw thee out on thine ear! I would."
"So my servant told thee that I sit on the Council of Mages? Perhaps I shall dismantle him to adjust a loose tongue..."
"Of course, this was before the Storms. No sailor will brave these dangerous waters now."
"My promised word shall never be broken."
"Excellent."
"As I had feared, the imbalance hath grown too powerful..."
"That is it, indeed. I thank thee for telling me... But thou mayest keep it if thou wishest."
"'Tis just through here..."
"If thou dost think I can be of use..."
"According to legend, the plant is found in the deepest and most dangerous part of the forest."
"Oh, everyone simply calls me 'Nanna'."
"'Tis the northwest corner room."
"Perhaps another time then."
"When one is an innkeeper one must run around all day long. If anyone wants anything thou art the one who must take care of it for them!"
"I am Csil the Healer, although in a past life I was known as Abrams. I became Csil when I was advanced."
"To know nothing about the altars. To wonder what you mean?"
"As the leader of the Wolves -- "
This toddler is full of energy and is playing hard when he sees you. He stops what he is doing.
"All Gwani people very happy to know Gwenno alive again!"
"Thou dost not have enough money!"
"I can see thou art so poor that thou cannot even afford a sense of humor!"
"'Great storms, the containers of hope smashed, lost love forgiven and restored' -- we still seek their meanings."
"The wounds have been healed."
"Mmmmmmm. Papa! Mama love Papa!"
"Besides, thou wast guilty of the crime, meaning that thou wast in the forbidden bedchamber..."
"Beware! The energy of the stones here is drawing away thy power to keep me imprisoned..."
"Ruggs is a sailor, for sure. Although he seems to take well to gardening now that he's on shore."
"Art thou interested in buying a spell perhaps? I could always use more money for ale..."
"Excellent, Avatar!"
"Quite amazing. I have been beaten by thee! Perhaps it is time for the teacher to learn from the student."
"This is the Bull Tower, knave. State thy business or be gone. We have no time for idle chit-chat with Goblins about."
"I believe 'twas the removal of the psyche from the Core that caused this island to sink beneath the waves."
"...not me, of course, but he hath had his way with many other beautiful women! Thou wouldst be surprised to learn of many of them."
"We have no maps to aid thee, I fear. But I know that there is a book describing the old temples in the abbey."
"Thou art weak of character! Or otherwise thou wouldst understand what I tried to do!"
"May it nourish thee, felon."
"So I look after him as best I can, even as he doth care for me. It also helps that everyone believes the tale we have spread."
"Thou wilt tell, wilt thou not?"
"I hope some of these powerful Mages will help me find him."
You see a friendly-looking farmer who waves at you as you approach.
"I can give thee 4 filari for every 3 guilders thou hast."
"Thou art an ill-mannered buffoon!"
"Thou didst agree to help with mine experiments. Why hast thou not taken the energy globe to the tower on the plains?"
"Now that there is a living phoenix in this world, the balance between Order and Chaos can be restored."
"Thou hast paid the price, I shall grant thee thy desires. Thou hast but to ask."
"What spell dost thou wish to purchase?"
"The other two Adepts are Gustacio the Green Mage, and the Red Sorceress, Rotoluncia."
"We must intervene, Karnax. The very fabric that weaves the tapestry of the Cosmos may depend upon it."
He turns to his right and speaks to no one.
"Even through all the stars above."
"Addom is mine husband. But how did...?" She appears confused, but suddenly directs her gaze at you. "Hast thou seen him?"
"Very old. Maybe as old as the Serpent ruins, maybe not. I'm not a Mage."
"Then do not return unless thou hast had a change of heart! I am saddened beyond bearing!"
"Dost thou wish to sell more armour?"
"Wouldst thou like to purchase something else?"
"To have detected a change in the structure of the world, by means of an Imbalance of Essences."
"That is correct!"
"I think that we shall be safe from their raiding parties, now that the Lady hath admitted us within the city walls."
"The tides have gone. It will be many days before the roots can again be gathered."
"Leave immediately! Thou dost not treat a Master so in Moonshade!"
"To be acceptable."
"Yes, thou mayest drink thy fill of ale here. But I am particularly fond of mine own personal brand of ale. Have a drink?"
You see a farm woman. She rubs her hands, which are covered with dirt and lines drawn by toil.
"Oh. Thou art as lost as I, eh? Then we shall surely die in here."
"A prince of a man! Why, when he breaks into song, I can hardly keep the crowds out of mine inn!"
"'Twould be good to share a joke or two with him!"
"All they think of are jewels and gold, until they've driven out all the beauty!"
"The wand is known as the Philanderer's Friend. I know not where it lies. Good luck, adventurer!"
"Hast thou not already met him? He is my older brother, and my friend."
"I tell thee, Krayg is the traitor..."
"With whom dost thou wish to train?"
"Thou shouldst take it to her quickly!"
"Yet, I doubt if there can be any victory. How can Imbalance be victory? We are opposites, not enemies."
The man greets you with stern, suspicious eyes.
"Perhaps Lady Yelinda will spare my life, when she understands my role -- I, too, was a victim!"
"Tends to be a bit lazy, though. Must teach him better. Make certain he learns as much as he thinks he knows."
"They say that Shmed was the traitor who sold our secrets to the Goblins."
"If thou hast need of my services later, I will be here."
"If thou wilt not tell me thy name and business, thou canst not enter the city. Come back when thou art feeling more talkative."
"Actually, that is rather unpleasant work. A bit discourteous to talk about it in mixed company, if thou dost know what I mean."
"I can give thee 2 gold coins for every 3 guilders thou hast."
"Now that I think about it, I remember hearing that they worship the forces of Order and Chaos, albeit in the forms of snakes."
"Youth is hers forever."
You see a stern but friendly-looking man, dressed in a military fashion. As you watch him, you get the feeling he is sizing you up as well.
"Gloat if thou wilt! Even if thou slayest me here thou hast not truly defeated me!"
"Thou hast returned! Wilt thou release me from this forsaken island?"
"I have many more things in my shop. Many things of high quality and great value as well. Please keep looking."
"Unless Balance is restored, this land shall die... And take every world that touches it into the dust of oblivion as well."
"I have suspected it! No skill have I in such deep matters, but perchance our speech might turn to enchantment when our quest is complete."
"Very well. But be careful if thou dost happen by the caves!"
"That it is, Boris."
"Well, I dutifully passed the Test of Knighthood when I was fifteen. But frankly, not everyone was born to be a Knight. I admit it."
"Thou hast earned the right to wear the Knight's Tattoo. Without it, one cannot be inducted into one's Knighthood."
"Perhaps another time then..."
"There. 'Tis done!"
"I cannot give thee the locket. Thou art too encumbered. Come back after thou hast put a few things down."
"I will wager that thou wouldst feel the injustice."
"For I have lost my lady, my love,"
"Do not tarry overlong in thy goodbyes to thy friends, Hero. Our land has little time left for sentiment."
"I am so glad that thou hast agreed to meet me here."
"Ha! Thou dost think I would squander my lust on the likes of thee?! A Mundane!!! I laugh at thee."
The more I would experiment with it, the closer I would come to success.
"To see Forbrak or Quaeven, then. To know they see all the citizens regularly."
"The only thing worse than this miserable existence is having Merrick sniff around and try to recruit us! The bloody parasite!"
"Thou dost not have enough gold to buy a ship!"
"I fear that thou dost already know this one..." ~"Wouldst thou like to hear it again?"
"I suspected that thou knewest when thou didst catch Spektor and I together that time. But we could not fool thee..."
"To have none!" He glares fiercly at you."
"Greetings, Stranger from Another Land. Once again, I am speaking to thee by means of a magic scroll."
"I will tell thee a tale of vaulting ambition laid low by the hands of time."
"All I remember is that I was with Number 1 when last we saw Number 7. I wonder where he hath gone?"
"Here is thy key. Be warned, 'twill only work in this establishment, and only for one use."
"I thank thee."
"To have a deal."
"The power of a Xenkan monk comes from a connection to the limitless Void that surrounds the universe."
"Dost thou waste the time of other mages as well?"
"Thou dost agree, since thou dost not speak well of the Beast! Aye, a tyrant if there ever were one."
"I enjoy all the attention..."
"I am sure thou canst find the man who killed Father!"
"Interesting name, is it not?"
"Here it is."
"Fine by me!"
"Thou hast not the gold for that!"
"Art thou daft? I have already given thee the key. Thy friend is locked in the jail. It is in the northeast part of town."
"They seem to have taken over our lives. They seem to have taken over our country!"
"I am a servant in Lord British's castle. I serve as a gentleman's gentleman, among other things. Right now I am serving wine."
"I cannot change the rules of the Test. Therefore, I cannot admit thee, stranger."
"He is nice, I suppose, but he is also a doddering old fool. I do not think he hath had a brain for more than a decade."
"Lucilla said what?! She finds me repulsive? Thou dost lie, it is a filthy lie..."
"Perhaps another time then..."
Never, NEVER, surrender to thine enemies.
"Begone with thee, fool..."
"Listen ta him, wilt thou? Art thou sayin' that thou art Fawn's bard now, Olon?"
"Oh, how I envy thee! But I am old now, and have my researches to content me."
"Greetings, Stranger from Another Land. I am speaking to thee by means of this magic scroll -- there is no need to be afraid."
You see a man with a sour expression on his face holding a baby boy. As he sees you, his face brightens.
"'Tis a lovely space in which to perform. I have dedicated my life to acting, thou knowest."
"Shmed hath retired early from his career as a soldier and now operates the Knight's Test -- "
"Thou art a most unusual human."
"There are three strangers on this island that have washed ashore in a shipwreck. Perhaps thou shalt meet them."
"There is a song about the lady." ~"Wouldst thou care to hear it?"
"Of The Fellowship. We meet every night at the hall. Thou shouldst visit!"
The ceremonial breastplate of the Priestess of Beauty, who is Kylista of Fawn. A very attractive lady, I should add.
"Most men seem to find me attractive... Except for the Pikemen. I had wondered why. Thank thee for the enlightening information."
"He looks like he hath had one too many tips of the bottle, if ya know what I mean."
"Magical swords are very difficult to deal with. In some cases, I can be of aid, but other cases require the assistance of a Mage."
"As the sand dwindles within the Hourglass of Fate, the danger will only increase. Thou must find the answer quickly, Avatar!"
"I am Raymundo."
"Please do not mention this to Petra -- she would never forgive me for lowering my prices like this."
"She asked me to convey her apologies to thee, and to present thee with three gifts."
"Would thou like some?"
"Thou art not a mage, or I would have detected thy powers by now."
"The enchanted ring shall protect thee."
"To go now to the brass gate, Hero. To meet you there and to let you return to the surface."
"Not so fast, peasant! I have a special punishment reserved for those who dare to play games with my mistresses..."
"So here I am! I kin give ye three hints ta help ye on yer way. So listen well."
"Then we shall find the secret of his power, and he shall not stop me from obtaining my freedom."
"If thou dost want a ship, thou must get a deed from the shipwright. Thou must also have the password to leave town."
"Wouldst thou like something else?"
"To mean `rock one.'"
You see a handsome, creative-looking young man.
"Failure in BrendanUsable(_Talking) because we couldn't find the door."
"Very well... perhaps another time."
"Wouldst thou care for more?"
"As for Fawn, the place is obsessed with strange customs. And they worship Beauty -- now, how can that compare to Courage?"
"Well, honey, it does not matter who thou art. We shalt have a good time anyway."
"Why dost thou not leave me alone?"
"Umm... why, the head curved to the right, and the body was most sinuous. Why dost thou ask?"
"'Tis truly amazing... thou hast a facile tongue to make me lower my price by so much."
"Another time, then..."
"Given the architecture, this must be one of the old Serpent temples. So I assume that this may have been where the altar once stood."
"One of thy belongings is now on the ground."
The man greets you with a pleasant smile.
"Do not bring that thing near me! If thou dost desire to know its nature, ask of Templar..."
"That is correct. I was taking a walk. Sometimes I want to exercise and enjoy the fresh air."
You see a disgruntled, obviously overworked barmaid. She gives you a perfunctory grunt of a hello.
A courageous man knows that one can leave the battlefield only two ways: By eliminating all of the enemies or in death.
"Perhaps in my next life I shall see him again. But not for any prolonged period of time, I hope."
"If thou hast need of my services later, I will be here."
"A fighting man named Gorn once bought a shovel from me and he told me that it saved his life."
"I myself belong to the Command of the Wolf."
"Which of you wishes to train?"
"The cost for a room is 12 filari per person. Dost thou want one?"
"I am sorry, but thou hast not enough gold for that!"
"This must wait. There is no time for delay!"
"A ring so pretty must be intended for a loved one. Perhaps a ring of marriage or engagement."
"Then if thou wouldst like to bet against Sprellic, thou mayest see Daphne, but I warn thee thou wilt be throwing thy money away!"
"Very good, Avatar."
Logic will illuminate the tunnel of ignorance for thee. It will bring thee confidence and knowledge.
"A work of divine wisdom, certainly! It is where Xenka inscribed all of her visions."
"Why, my name is Greg. It is good to see thee."
"If thou wilt give me the Dream Crystal, we will all be freed."
"What can he be doing? He says that he doth have an old injury, but he's merely a snivelling coward."
"Then thou must look elsewhere for that service."
"Then thou must be brave indeed! Monitor hath never before welcomed outsiders into the ranks of the Pikemen." *"I am honored to meet thee."
"Look for a young lad talking to a parrot. That will be him."
"So I have given away thy secret? Do not beat me! Please Master! Do not beat me!"
"The Prophecies of Xenka speak of the Storms of Imbalance."
"Here it is."
"Some fell sorcery brought me here and nothing I do can unlock the door. Release me and together we shall find the key to this mystery!"
"I have no time for this!"
"Squeamish at the sight of blood, are ya? The morning star is the true warrior's mace."
"If not, then be on thy way."
"I knew that Edrin could not be so misled..."
"The Wolves repaired the ancient highway, and added new roads to link the Three Cities. They built the guard towers."
"I have lost the contact -- there are strange forces connected with this spirit!"
"I'm glad he met Mistress Devra."
"Let us just say that thou dost inspire me... I can promise thee that I shall be... creative."
"Ho ho ha ha heh heh heh!"
"I watch over my flock, and the townspeople as well, when they need me."
"'Tis done!"
"Once Frederico threw a rock through the window of the local Fellowship branch... Oh, well, I thought it was amusing!"
"If thou didst enjoy my song, I would appreciate a small contribution to my room and board."
"Leave thee at a time such as this? Surely, thou dost jest. Onward!"
"I feel that the ether is flowing smoothly now. Magic is alive again!"
"You really expect me to believe that? You're just in this for the money."
"Thou cannot possibly carry that much!"
"Only thou, the Stranger from Another World, canst visit us now."
"Devra's a fine woman, for all that she is a bit domineering... But then most women are, are they not?"
"This noise over Owen's monument, for instance. People ought to tend to their own business and let others handle their own, foolish or not."
"There was also a warrior named Brunt who travelled with Batlin. He was small in stature, but with incredibly broad shoulders --"
"If thou dost change thy mind, ask me again!"
"I know this feels awkward. Practice with this and thou wilt see no loss of accuracy."
"If thou dost want food or drink, or perhaps a room, please say so."
"Very well, I have been found out. Listen to my secrets, brute, for I must confess all with my dying breath..."
"Mother say thou found medicine make me better. Thank thou! My name Neyobi! Thou know what that mean?"
"If thou had the item I am certain I could tell thee more about it."
"Things have been very peaceful in New Magincia. There has been little trouble from outsiders lately."
"The local Lords and Mayors all have residences that are maintained through the auspices of the Kingdom."
"Dost thou want me to wait here or shall I go on home?"
"If I accepted such a price, I would have to close my shop and begin begging!"
"Sir Horffe has chosen to use the Gargish syntax of our language so he may better maintain his cultural ties."
"Hasten! The Imbalance grows stronger..."
"Hah hah hah hah!"
"To be where the three altars of singularity are kept."
From the desk of the Great Hierophant.
"I do not allow beggars in here!"
"Simon is the barkeep at the inn. He knows more than anyone in town about exotic beverages."
"Isn't that the truth..."
"Glad to make thine aquaintance."
"But say, thou must have gotten here in some manner! Dost thou have some manner of ship on which we could leave the island?"
"I sell meats here at the Farmer's Market in Britain."
"To want something else?"
"Xenka disappeared several centuries ago. No one knows where she went."
"These caverns are fairly large, a fact that suited me because I myself am fairly large."
"Thou hast already met her."
"Father will be most upset to learn of this..."
"Thanks to thee for liberating the Helm of Monitor from the Goblins. Thou hast truly earned the title of Champion Knight."
Shamino hands you the pocketwatch.
"I started hearing it around the time my magic began to fail. I do not find it amusing."
"Aye! That be the truth! No woman would have him!"
Logic is mightier than magic.
"What place art thou interested in?"
"I've done all the cooking here since Donal hired me, before I married Angus. I've had my share of compliments, if I do say so myself."
"Fawn is known for its statuary, while Moonshade is the City of Mages. Perhaps thou shouldst inquire there."
"Find thyself a spellbook before thou dost seek to buy from me again!"
"Thanks for thy witness, good merchant."
"The Wolves are known for their cunning and stealth, preferring dexterity over brute strength. Brendann is their leader."
"Zulith is Lady Yelinda's secretary. He schedules her audiences and acts as a messenger between her Ladyship and the Great Captains."
"Ambrosia, the lost isle of Britannia! Thou art really here!"
"Return to Monk Isle, and return with fresh roots of the Mandrake!"
"If thou shouldst bring a return message, I will introduce thee to my shipmate, Scots, who makes maps."
"Very well."
"Thou art returned! What tortures hast thou devised for me, Order dog?"
"Perhaps thou shalt be able to solve this mystery. I have been unable to as of yet. But I shall remain here until its secret is revealed."
"To carry too much already!"
"We citizens are so much nicer to thee when thou art a Knight, rather than a stranger. We distrust outsiders."
"Now that I know something about thee, it is only fair that I tell thee that my name is Draxinar. My friends, however, call me 'Stumpy'."
"Sorcery is outlawed here in Moonshade, but that doth not mean that some Mages do not still practice its dark arts."
"Front entrance is too much danger! Must be other entrance!"
"Wouldst thou like to buy some meats?"
"Since thou dost not have enough room for this last item, I will place it at thy feet."
"I accept thine offer!"
"I must be a fool for doing this, but I will accept thine offer. Please, do not tell anyone about this..."
"Makes me ill to think about them!"
"Oh. Never mind, then."
"I can give thee 200 gold coins for any piece of jewelry thou hast."
"So, thou hast found me out? Well, to the blazes with it all!"
"Art thou sure? I will give thee information in return."
"How else shall I make money, eh? I will accept this price."
"Hard to say. He doth not talk much, and always seems to be in a hurry..."
"A love story about ice dragons! Now I've heard everything, even from thee, Olon."
"The Mad Mage thinks that he can learn to create life. Or life from death, I should say."
"She's a Horticulturist, Olon. Thou shouldst only give facts..."
"To be known as Inforlem."
"She is convinced that some outside force is responsible for these abominable storms."
"I cannot recall having seen any of the women in town with slippers like these."
"Pray, settle thy mind!"
"These earrings are of ancient devising, and I was told that they would be most flattering to thee."
"What dost thou care to exchange for filari?"
"I am sorry, I do not join thieves."
"Mine husband, Carvell, died when Draygan took a group of men in search of gold. Only Draygan returned."
"'Tis unwise to change thy mind after agreeing to a firm price!"
"Shamino should be here with us."
"Xenka was a very wise woman, oh great one. Divine visions came to her to warn us of the end of our world."
"Curse thee, then! I shall take the secret of the Goblins with me to my grave..."
"In better times, caravans travelled these routes, and we collected a fat reward from merchants eager for our protection."
"The stockings that thou didst take from Shmed were made in the city of Fawn."
"Thou shouldst discard it in some safe place, such as a remote isle or distant mountaintop."
"The slaves, Avatar! Thou didst release them all! Damn thee!"
"If thou dost mean what I think thou dost mean, please, meet me in my barracks tonight."
You see a short woman with a distracted look on her face.
"I wish I could have been of more help to thee..."
"I can give thee 1 gold coin for every 2 filari thou hast."
"Well, I am sure thou wilt find the right person one day."
"Follow me through the gate, Avatar! Thou wilt soon be home..."
"Thou wilt find no better rates..."
"Perhaps we may speak at another time. Mine husband is recently dead, and I am in mourning."
"Seek Jorvin's aid. He is well trained with the devices of battle. I shall content myself with a mug and broom..."
"I grieve that his wits seem to have left him. But at least he is safe with me."
"Oh, yes! It might be as simple as putting out a fire and rebuilding a section or two of wall after."
"To tell you that his weanling, Inamo, is in Trinsic at this time."
"Thou dost not have 150 gold! Speak with me when thou dost have the money."
"I grow a few crops. Especially carrots and wheat."
"I feared that no one could save me from Draygan, for he is invincible!"
"When my shop is again open I shall be more than happy to help thee."
"In fact, this is what I shall do for thee! Since thou didst make it possible for Hawk to sail us here, I shall repay thee --"
"We are betrayed! Take Kylista from my sight! I shall deal with her perfidy later..."
"I attributed it to a disturbance in the ethereal waves! I had to find out what was happening. So here I am!"
"We are strangers here. Thou dost well in questioning us. We wrong thee with our demands to be unaccountable."
"If thou hast the stomach to face great danger, then perhaps we can resume the quest for the lost gold."
"Here they are."
"The Master's house is very old, and constantly in need of repair."
I believe in the ways of Tolerance, Enthusiasm and Emotion.
"The cost is 8 gold coins per person. Wouldst thou like a room for the night?"
"That is the greatest gift that I can give to thee. Use it wisely."
"I am the tailor of Moonglow."
"Dost thou have an interest in mere Mundanes, or Mages?"
"And now that mountain, tried by fire and ice, lies crushed beneath another's dream."
"Instead, I shall remain here. After all, what can one old woman do for thee?"
"If thou dost wish me to bond the gem to the sword, thou hast but to command me, master."
"What is this that they say?"
"He is a gambler by profession, who earns his winnings at the House of Games's tables on Buccaneer's Den."
"Dost thou wish to make a sword?"
"Dost thou find the rate acceptable?"
"Green fellows. Hospitable. Be thou sure to accept their dinner invitation."
"If thou dost visit the Temple whilst thou art here, I am sure that thou wilt be able to hear for thyself."
"Thou shalt regret thy words!"
"I think the Gargoyle hath tricked us, Avatar. Never trust their type..."
"That is what Gladstone says. Thou hadst better ask him about it."
"I fear that my companions and I will be the next delicacy in the Goblin stewpot without thy protection."
"We are leaving this dungeon now that our quest is over."
"Why, that looks exactly like the engagement ring that Keth gave Alyssand!"
"Personally, I think that anyone possessing that much power is a bad idea."
"He is the trainer. Quite a good fighter from what I hear."
"A scroll? What dost thou mean?"
"Of course, I can never allow thee to leave this chamber alive..."
"How canst thou be so trusting? How hast thou lived so long?"
"She is the monk who tends the garden at the Abbey."
"Couldst thou please make up thy mind!?"
"Ah, yes, Mariah is very nice."
"Weapons or missiles?"
When trouble and anguish come upon thee, Ethics will give thee the strength to overcome.
"A fair deal..."
"Come lift a glass wit' me, lad. Tell me what a brave Pikeman like ye have been a doin'."
"What didst thou expect?"
"Who doesn't?"
"Never dreamed a crusty old salt like meself would end my days on the Great Captain's Council."
The missing apparatus from the laboratory of Erstam, the so-called Mad Mage.
"I would have loved to study that fascinating Gem of Immortality, but alas, I was born in too late an era."
A pair of moonsilk stockings, such as the enchantress Columna doth wear.
"Voldin, thou dost extend thyself too far!"
"Cost him a pretty penny, I'll wager."
I believe that believing in Tolerance will teach me the acceptance of all things.
"I can give thee 40 filari for every 1 gold nugget thou hast."
"Thou canst not carry thy drink!"
"Here is the potion."
"A wonderful woman. Thou shouldst meet her."
"Don't rant on about the goblins, Olon! 'Tis not a fit subject ta discuss before a lady."
"Thy companions will have to help thee with this burden."
"Thou dost not have a spellbook."
"Rocco hath led everyone to believe that he and Torrissio reached an agreement to have me work here to advertise Torrissio's skill."
"We offer honest prices here at the Sleeping Bull!"
"...he's rather cute."
"I can give thee 25 monetari for every gem thou dost have."
"Perhaps thou wouldst wish to join our Fellowship?"
"I am sorry, Avatar. I will try to do well and be a more valuable member of the Fellowship. I beg thee, do not speak of this to Elynor."
"Besides, I have this new shield -- which, by the way, is a family heirloom. Thank thee very much."
"I bid you all a pleasant dinner. I have lost mine appetite and am leaving. But mark my words -- I shall have my way!"
"Look, man, thou art a Bear like myself! Obey me now, and all will be right."
"Very well, then!"
"That item is used for researching the properties of magic, and to create new spells."
"To inform you that The Fellowship is directed by two winged brethren. To be called Runeb and Quan."
"Very well. If thou hast need of my services later, I will be available."
"Oh, I surrender!"
"Then just play it!"
"Cave good. Warm. Safe."
"I think thou wilt find these to be exceptionally beautiful."
"Well, they certainly have nothing like that in New Magincia. I had never even heard of such a thing before!"
"I have the morning watch guarding the dock. I authorize the comings and goings of every ship."
"Of course we did, Priestess. Men have always had the advantage over the weaker sex..."
"Thou must mean Shamino and Dupre."
"She's my serving wench, as well as being a damn fine cook -- which, considering she can neither eat nor taste, is rather incredible."
"'Tis mighty curious for thee to know so little of our customs -- art thou certain thou art a Knight?"
"I knew thou wert learning, Rocco."
"Please! I cannot help thee until I am protected from the damaged ether!"
"Foolish mortal! The time hath come to relieve thee of the burden of thy life for it is also my time to feed!"
"We have stalked each other long enough!"
"But I have developed an experiment to test this theory, and thou canst help me with it."
"Thou wouldst never believe it! Boydon hath become very friendly with young Bucia of the Canton, and spends much time with her."
"If thou art ever interested, find me."
"Marsten is the traitor? This is too incredible to believe. Hast thou proof?"
"Come, Avatar... Come and meet thy death!"
"Thy companions will have to help thee carry some of these things."
"If thou dost wish to visit her, she lives in a manor in the northeast corner of the city."
"I do not know his name. The evil wizard travels throughout the Serpent Isle, in search of children to steal for the mage school."
"If it is, then it belongs in the Temple. Perhaps thou shouldst leave it before the Oracle."
"Just look for the crater near the northeast coast. Thou shalt find him there."
"Dost thou waste the time of other mages as well?"
"If thou dost change thy mind, Yurel will still trade."
"I shall have to count my fingers after thou dost leave. Thou art a slick bargainer, indeed!"
"What art thou saying?! I was with Number 2 when Number 7 disappeared!"
"This stranger came into my shop and asked many strange and personal questions concerning the Sorceress Frigidazzi."
As you place your hand in the furnace that is the dragon's maw, you can't help but wonder if a small gem is worth the risk.
"To tell you about them later if you wish."
"But the Avatar is not a Mundane..."
"If thou dost fail in thy quest, our world will end... ripped apart by the storms and earthquakes that doth now plague it."
"Wouldst thou care for more?"
"My name is Sean."
"Failure in BrendanUsable(_Action, not $Temp1Flag) because //$ we were unable to find the guard."
"Greetings again."
"To say that many Men have come here to steal the wealth of the Lost City."
"Thou dost look at me oddly... I think I have said too much!"
"Use the key to obtain the waters of Logic. Thou hast well earned that honor."
"Thou dost look pale, dear Iolo."
"I charge 35 gold for a training session. Doth this meet with thine approval?"
"Owen is our local shipwright. Frankly, I think he is something of a fool."
"Sweet things are desired by Emps. Honey is sweetest! More honey is had by you?"
"Even in our ancient homeland, the Statue of Beauty was controlled by the Great Captains. It said what we told it to."
You see a tough-looking guard who takes his job -very- seriously.
"Looking is free. Inspect the automaton-made goods."
"I have already heard that some of my fellow residents have had things stolen by those wretched creatures."
"What dost thou say to this?"
"Yes, as in `take a bath.' I must inform thee that thou dost truly stink!"
As often as not, I would run into a monster or an unknown species.
"Mandrakes grow only in certain swamps, of which there is one on this isle."
"Didst thou not see the storm which passed by here so recently? Even a Knight must hide from the fury of Nature!"
"My fee will leave thee with nothing!"
"Hahaha! What cruel joke the heavens have had at mine expense!"
"The stench has made our water taste terrible. That mining company must cease pouring their sewage into what was once a fine lake!"
"'Tis a pity thou art unavailable. Thou dost look like one who doth know their way around a kitchen."
Day 69 -- More have been eaten alive.
"Since thou dost not have enough room for this last item, I will place it at thy feet."
"Pumice is also found deep in the bowels of the world, where fire runs liquid."
"Where hast thou been all thy life, the frozen north?"
"I'll not even attempt to make the Arabella seaworthy until these blasted storms are over!"
"They are cunning and two-faced. I am working on obtaining proof of this."
"My darling husband, Iolo, although I am dead I must tell thee that my love for thee shall never die. Always remember me. Farewell."
"He is one of the few people in town that I like. He is nice to us."
"I shall protect thee... I shall take thee beyond all mortal concerns -- into my kingdom of death!"
"Free Gwenno... free her from the ice!"
"Fear is beneath me, and I refuse to let the creeping stink of fright soil my mind. I shall always be fearless."
"Hmmm. I can't recall having seen a bottle like this one. But then I don't generally try any vintages but our own."
"Oh, yes! Filbercio is quite a lady's man. And what woman would not jump at the opportunity to win the MageLord's favor?"
"Thou dost not have enough gold! Mayhaps thou couldst return when thou hast more."
"Very well. If thou art fortunate thou wilt not have cause to regret it."
"I can give thee 1 monetari for every 4 filari thou hast."
"I used to be a farmer here in Paws. Now I suppose I work for the Fellowship. I live in their shelter."
"Very well. But I warn thee that employment is hard to obtain in these times!"
"What sort of items art thou inquiring about?"
"I was appointed as Magister for life."
"Eyeh! Please, put it away!"
"The wounds have been healed."
"If thou canst not pay, then thou canst leave!"
"I have never seen this wondrous land. I have only felt its presence upon the edge of the Void."
"I have no name for what that power was. I know not if the intent was hostile or good."
"Arrgh..."
"Mosh is the town beggar. She's very ugly... and crazy, too."
"If that is what thou dost wish..."
"Here, what is not one is the other. This place is so isolated that it is backward. What is worse, they prefer it this way!"
"I have always thought it daring of Monitorian women to wear a tattoo. Tell me, do the Monitorian men find this alluring?"
"Hmmm... I think that thou shouldst consult my crystal ball. Perhaps it can provide a clue into the matter of the missing brother."
"Thou hast not completed thy tasks. Remember that Worthiness Precedes Reward. Once thou hast completed the missions, thou mayest join."
"So! Thy friend is not worth the price of justice, eh? Then let him rot!"
"If thou dost wish to take Knight's Test, thou must ask Lord Marsten for his permission."
"I would hear the full weight of the testimony against me, Lady Yelinda."
"Hmm..." ~"I suppose one must accept such a price -- though it could have been higher."
"Dost thou want to know about the one in charge or his clerk?"
"Could this possibly be true?" Erethian's blind eyes light up with unabashed glee. "What an opportunity I have here."
"Good. Thou hast my Serpent Staff... It was both a support and a weapon to smite those who would unseat the delicate balance."
"I try make him stop. But he talk and talk. You try? Maybe he stop."
I then tried the O rune in the first position, which was not where it belonged, and knew I could discern the puzzle...
"If that is what thou dost want, I will keep them for thee. Return when thou wantest them."
"Perhaps thou couldst speak to the Master Artisan. He hath made many baubles for the MageLord and his mistresses."
"Thou canst not fool me, brainless dolt. Thou dost not have enough gold!"
"Yes, master..."
"Slay me! Slay me with the Serpent Sword, and send my soul back into the Void!"
This actor has much stage presence and a booming voice.
"What a stench! This egg hath gone putrid!"
"The monks live and study there, but they do little more than winemaking. Well, I know one of them tends the garden."
"To sell you things when my shop is open."
"The Bears are strong and brave, and known for their triumphs in the arena. About whom dost thou wish to inquire?"
"If I were thee, I would avoid his domain... Although, I have heard that the liche possesses two fabulous treasures."
"In which circle dost thou wish to study?"
"I'm glad the old witch is dead. I only wish her curse had died with her..."
"Didst thou bring thine Orb of the Moons?"
"I am Delin, Fawn's provisioner. How may I serve thee, lady Pikeman?"
"A blue egg... doth not seem to be magical or in any way arcane..."
"But the crops have not been healthy, not since the strange storms afflicted the island."
"Fine. Go on and live thy life in peace and happiness."
The Cube vibrates.
"Do not worry -- we shall arrest these dogs!"
Return to me for the key when thou hast found the means to survive the heat.
"And I recognize thee as the Avatar! I know that thou art condemned to die!"
"It seems thou dost not have the funds to pay me..."
"Want to give me some?"
"The name is symbolic. Moon represents the powers beyond those of mere mortals, just as the moon is suspended over the world."
"Thou hast received payment. Make the delivery tonight."
"Thou dost not have enough gold for that!"
"Dost thou know the way out?"
"Contemplate it for the nonce, then."
"Thou dost not have enough gold for that!"
"Fawn is on the other island. Somewhere on the far side, I think. 'Tis a port. Filled with sailors."
"What wouldst thou like to whet thy palate?"
"The Priestess of Beauty hath confessed to me that she and Great Captain Voldin were united in an evil conspiracy."
"Some other time, then."
"Would that I had such power. That artifact would allow me to return to my home plane if only I could unlock its secrets."
"I could not see them well, for the mage kept my fellows and I locked within an energy field while he went about his evil work."
"She loved a King, a noble king, Who left her all forlorn."
"Stay away from 'em myself. But thou canst not miss 'em..."
"But all barbarians fear sorcery."
"I can give thee 4 filari for every 1 monetari thou hast."
"If thou hast a ritual blood-letting device -- which is technically forbidden as well -- thou must fill a small container with blood."
"And thou art? I'd throw thee out, if thou weren't mine only steady customer. I would."
"Thy friends will have to help carry these things."
"Spektor and I were lovers. Canst thou believe it? Yet there was something appealing about that man..."
"I see thou art ready? Very well. Take center stage, wouldst thou?"
"My friends are Battles and Leavell. Their job is to protect me and my winnings. In exchange they share in my profits."
"Whom wouldst thou care to call before the Oracle?"
"If thou bringest the scroll to me I can aid the in finding the meaning of the archaic text."
"Failure in NowSettleDownBoys() because we could not find the tournament door."
"Then thou hast companions beyond compare!"
"'Tis hard ta find many who have borne more, I'll wager."
"Say there, thou with the lute! Art thou a bard?"
"Very well, take five more of the Varo leaves and go thou quickly to Harnna!"
"This is an inn along the Serpent Highway. It is said that one could obtain passage on ships from there."
"The water from the well is pure and cool. If thou wouldst like I will pour thee some."
"Yet they do much more than merely advise. There are three of them -- Garth, Joth and Voldin."
"To be named Horffe."
"To be unable to carry that much, human!"
"Wonderful! Here is the bill. Please bring it back to me when it is signed. And we thank thee."
"Kane doth not have the sense of a cat!"
"Go back ta washin' the glasses, Jendon! Thou art no judge of what ta say in front of ladies."
"I have not seen or heard of Sasha since we last spoke of him. I do not know if he ever joined The Fellowship."
"Even now the storms flay the land. Soon the earthquakes will unleash the fire that will engulf the world."
"Thou hast wronged me!"
"I should have realized that it was not thine. See how crude the tracery is, and how ill the stones fit?"
"I do not understand humor, milady."
"I can give thee 20 gold coins for every 1 gold nugget thou hast."
"This is not funny in the least, Avatar."
"Thou dost not have that much gold! Mayhaps thou couldst return with more and purchase the service then."
"Ye might say that I'm a part o' yer prophecy... One o' yer guides like."
"Well, so few people are, really."
"He vas my father's brother. He is a good man and vise. Now he is the leader of our people. He vill do what is right for us."
"As I told thee, my name is Sir Jordan."
"Wilt thou take it?"
"To be able to call me Sarpling."
"I suppose I have no job, but is that really so bad? I am a member of The Fellowship and I talk to people about them all day long."
The well-worn slippers belonging to Devra, the mistress of the Inn of the Sleeping Bull.
"I am Leavell."
"Let this be swift. Ask thy questions."
"Bane of Chaos... Chaos Bane... twisted her soul..."
"Thou shalt pay!"
"To be on holiday at the moment. To have only Miranda and myself present to enact this new law."
"What be thou interested in?"
"I am afraid the bakery is closed. Please come back during normal business hours."
"This seemed to be an... appropriate place to start up a branch. There are many good citizens here in Moonglow."
"Dost thou seek to torment me with useless questions, or may I be of some service..." A long pause, "Master."
"How many crested helms wouldst thou care to sell?"
"I thought I was wasting my breath on thee."
"I can give thee 1 monetari for every 3 guilders thou hast."
The gargoyle welcomes you by making a sweeping motion with his open hand.
"Monsters! There are monsters lurking in dungeon Destard?! Well then, I do apologize for thine inconvenience."
"Yes, Master... I am sorry... Please do not beat me...!"
"I shall never live this down, if thou dost tell anyone..."
"If only one of us is correct, how many creatures has Longtooth stumped with his riddles?"
"There are three cities in the Serpent Isles, and a small hamlet. Of which can I tell thee?"
"What do ye care about the name of a wretch?"
"Then I am sorry, I do not have any time to spare for thee."
"It will serve that cretin good, to be entombed with the rats and maggots in that prison."
"Thou mayest find the book here in the Chapel, upon the altar."
"I have no more questions. Many thanks for thy service, Delphynia. Return to thy seat, if thou wilt."
"'Tis that she-witch, Rotoluncia! Everyone knows that she doth work against thee."
"She healer, and smartest person in whole world!"
"If there is one thing I cannot stand, it is being hamstrung by petty politics. Thou art not half the man thou once wert, Filbercio..."
"'Tis the northwest corner room."
"The dog doth not come! Perhaps thou shouldst try the whistle in a more open place, where the sound will travel."
"To sell during shop hours. To ask you to come back to me at that time, please."
"Thou didst do this for jest?!"
"Have snakes carved all over 'em. Left behind by the ancient inhabitants of this land. Horrible Daemonic folk."
"Nothing is more important than one's honor! I am a valiant man, and I can promise thee three things --"
"Yes, I remember him! He is lost, too! Dost thou know if he found his way out? Give him my best when thou dost speak to him."
"Where oh where is Batlin? He is late for the meeting!"
You see a dashing, slender man, stylishly dressed, with a lot of flair.
"To have less than enough gold for that."
"To be known as Wislem."
"The transaction is done!"
"It is because of what I learn in my studies that I may grow my flowers to be so large and healthy."
A strange blue egg.
"Thou cannot possibly carry that much!"
"He and his mother reject The Fellowship. They are witless and stupid and I do not like them."
"I renounce Lord British and everything for which he stands. From this moment forward, I am his friend and servant no longer."
"My daughter is not on trial here, chancellor..."
"I'm certain it was thy pack of jackals that killed the Great Hierophant! Without Ssithnos' guidance, we are lost... Even thee, dog!"
"As thou wishest..."
"Welcome to the Apothecary Shop. I am Pothos, the proprietor."
"Perhaps another time then..."
"To say that several generations of gargoyles have dwelled here. To assure you that this place was old before we came."
"Thou art holding back something..."
"Hmm. Thou art a little short on gold. Perhaps thou couldst visit the House of Games, win some booty, then return!"
"Perhaps thou canst return with more companions, for thou hast not room to carry what thou desirest to purchase!"
"I'm not so far gone in me cups as ta not be able ta see the mark that thou bearest on thy face. All the world knows thee for a Pikeman."
"I do not like it, but there is not much mortals can do against a City of Mages..."
"Only a prism purified by the water of the appropriate temple can hold each Bane. Otherwise, the prism will be ineffective."
This regal gentleman epitomizes a well-liked politician.
"My rates are the same as every other moneychanger..."
"The honey from the caves is quite tasty, but rarely can one get it without a fight. The Bee Caves can be a rather dangerous place."
"In what way may I assist thee?"
"But those are so easy to avoid..."
"To be Passion, Control, and Diligence. To be the values that most gargoyles hold as the key of our existence."
"Ha ha hah hah!"
"Why, the man is a known drunkard, and a companion of thieves and cut-throats. Look at those he consorts with!"
"Return here if thou art unsure of how to proceed. I shall guide thee in some small fashion."
"And here in Moonshade, I'm afraid, Mundanes are little better than chattel."
"My pleasure..."
"Rankin is in charge of the entire local branch. If thou hast any questions about The Fellowship, he can answer them."
"Do not mention that name again, Rocco! Why summon more trouble than we already have?"
"Adviser for military matters, that is. Some consider me to be an expert in tactics."
"I am Mandy."
"We must follow the coast north, and then turn east."
"I regret that thou wilt not aid the Cause. Nevertheless, we will not be turned from our quest to save this society."
"Dost thou accuse me?"
You see an elderly man with good humor and a warm smile.
"I don't think she said, but I did perceive it was somewhere like Monitor."
Everyone in the Blue Boar laughs.
You see a handsome and flamboyant musician.
"'Tis a pity that so much hath changed without my being here..."
"I envy thee the chance to kill Pomdirgun. I hope thou didst make him suffer!"
"You are thanked."
"I will give thee the password when thou hast given me a report on the progress of thine investigation."
"Thou dost not even have a single gold piece! Nor the decency to inform me that I was wasting my time in talking with thee."
"Perhaps this would be a more appropriate topic when I am at work."
"Hast thou seen Batlin? He has not shown up for the Fellowship meeting!"
"Prepare yourselves for the coming of Xenka!"
"Do I believe in Daemonism? Of course. My mother told me the legends when I was a mere child."
"I can give thee 400 filari for any piece of jewelry thou hast."
"Wouldst thou care to buy something else?"
"Damn thee, Avatar!"
"I suppose I don't know what to believe -- pardon me, Kylista..."
"Ah... home again. I never tire of rocky little islands. Dost thou truly wish to go to the forsaken Isle of Fire?"
"Thou shouldst try opening the chest."
"A crime that involved magic must be handled by the Council of Mages, naturally."
"I thank thee for thy time, Lady Yelinda. Thou hast spoken fairly, as always."
"I am leaving -- do not try to stop me!"
"It is only reasonable that these buttons hold the way out. Though they also hold much more..."
"What dost thou take me for, a Mundane?!"
"Thou dost really want to hear it? 'Tis very long."
"The tactic seems to have worked because I have had little trouble from the creatures since I erected the barriers."
"The way to do this is the secret held by the Chaos Hierophant. Now thou must seek him out!"
"But I fail to see any connection between that good lady, and this trial."
"Thou hast been beaten in a fair spar. Perhaps now thou wilt be more humble."
"Which of my powers dost thou seek to use?"
"I have never heard of a blue egg."
"If thou dost travel in a lighter fashion, thou wouldst have hands to take my gold!"
"I resent that, my friend. Bows and crossbows can be wielded with deadly effect."
"My, what a fine-looking warrior! How might I be of service to thee?"
"My name is Finnigan."
"It IS true."
"Perhaps I should not speak with thee... I hope thou art not come to rob me!"
"I know many songs..." ~"Dost thou wish to hear one I have already sung?" ~"Or dost thou wish to hear a new song?"
"How many wouldst thou like?"
"She is nearly ready to become a Knight herself now. Her father would be so proud of her!"
"I thank thee for freeing me from the yoke of the Great Captains, stranger. Thy friend is safe and I may once again speak the Truth."
"To be agreed!"
"Oh, it isn't that much of a challenge. After all, thou didst survive it, Flicken!"
"I feared that I had lost both thee and my beloved wife, but thou hast survived the depths even as Dupre assured me that thou wouldst..."
"I have no 'job' per se. I have devoted mine energies to helping The Fellowship. I hope to recruit new members."
"Poor critter. Thou shouldst give it a decent burial... Before Jendon sees it, if thou dost know what be good for thee."
"What peace is left for us here, guardians of an empty shell now that the mage hath loosed what once was captive?"
"It is truly a jewel in the crown that is Britannia."
"A pity! Then what I do not receive willingly, I will have to take by force!"
"'Tis not uncommon to see the symbol of the serpent among the ruins, yet I have never seen before or since any such Rock Serpent."
"And that includes Argus."
"As thou wish, master. I but seek to serve thee."
"What dost thou wish, food or healing potions?"
"They would be Katrina, the shepherd, and Constance, the water carrier."
"Oh. Be that way, then. There are plenty of others who are interested in me!"
"Which of you dost wish to fight?"
"I will gladly sell to thee if thou wilt come to my father's shop when we are open for business."
"Then we have nothing further to discuss until thou dost go and bring it to me."
"Wouldst thou like something else?"
"Thou dost not have enough gold to get any fish and chips. Sorry!"
"Our people fled from their homeland when an evil tyrant united the kingdoms, and sought to force his philosophy upon them."
"Fool! Thou art too late. Now I shall enter the Wall of Lights and become immortal!"
"To be not selling at this time. To come back tomorrow to buy provisions."
"Perhaps another time then..."
"I'll thank thee ta keep thy comments ta thyself, Jendon. Thou art ruining my tale."
"She is one of the monks who lives at the Abbey. At this time, she is the only other person I have actually met here in the forest."
"Wouldst thou like some wine?"
"Thou art as cold-hearted as any man I have ever met! I can no longer tolerate thy company."
"Surely, thou canst save me! Slay him for me, and thou shalt have my most priceless reward!"
"Thou dost not know the Green Enchantress? Ah, perhaps thou wouldst recognize her by the spell she is famous for... Columna's Intuition."
"Do not worry. We shall not starve. Camille sends her son Tobias with food and clothing for us every so often."
I grew up in a tiny village on the southern coast. Life hath been good so far and I know it will be longer than this book.
"'Twas clear enough what it was... Its light was still shining after the storm." *"But none of the sailors recognized it."
"Turn the stomach of so bold a lad? Now where was I? Oh, yes..."
"But thou art merely a stranger here..."
"Our Pikemen patrol the major roads connecting Monitor with Fawn and Sleeping Bull, and man the guard towers."
"I am speaking to thee from beyond the grave. I shall have vengeance!"
"We must speak with Shmed about this. Our dungeon is strictly a test of fighting ability -- no magic allowed!"
"Let us move closer to the great wall..."
"Thou must inquire to see if anyone can identify this bottle."
"Delphynia is an herbalist."
"Place the globe on the platform, on top of the tower structure."
"I am afraid that thou must carry out a mission for us as a test of trust if thou art to begin truly walking with The Fellowship."
"Wouldst thou like something else?"
"Mortegro is fine. A bit flighty at times, but all mages are if thou dost ask me."
"Thou art having fun with me, stranger! I see no letter."
"Certainly..."
"I am Widow Harnna, the Healer of Monitor. I also sell vegetables from my garden."
"Look upwards, as well as from side to side. There are clues that would otherwise escape thee. Be prepared to climb."
"His name is Nicholas."
It might make possible the spells to flay men's minds, or set swords into dancing death, or to decimate entire cities.
"I made an appropriately large 'donation' to their coffers. But I did not expect them to waylay Hawk to rot in some jail cell!"
"Talk to Baiyanda, healer of our people. She will know what to do."
"I am the Healer of Serpent's Hold."
"Wouldst thou care to purchase something else?"
"A new Hero has entered this world... am I dreaming, or is he real?"
"Thou art too old to be an innkeeper, Rocco! Thy mind grows soft, like an over-ripe fruit."
"Return it to me... Perhaps the heavens shall once again smile upon Fawn."
"I usually live in the mountains, but I am lost in this dungeon."
"Thy raid of the Goblin camp and recovery of the Helm of Monitor will live in our history forever. Astrid is avenged!"
"Dost thou think me a fool, ta argue with me only ta change thy mind? I shall spread the word about thee in this town, wait and see!"
"Ummph. Thou art getting a good bargain with this price."
"To be Fellowship clerk."
"Hast thou reconsidered mine offer?"
"The events in the prophecies are wild and connected by no frame that we have been able to discover..."
"Oh, my!" he cries. "'Tis really the Avatar this time! Please do not hurt me, Avatar!"
"I have heard that thou art in need of... finances, shall we say."
"What wouldst thou like?"
"What coinage dost thou desire?"
"With these troubled times, I must charge higher prices..."
"When that strange storm struck, there was a flash, and then I found myself in a wilderness."
"The sailors trust and respect Joth. In mine heart, I cannot believe he is part of any conspiracy to control the Oracle."
"The Great Captains therefore have usurped many of her duties, on the pretext of sparing Yelinda from tedium."
"I thank thee for solving the mystery of who was behind it."
"Not all things in world meant to have answers. Gwani tried to live in balance with world, not force us on nature. Maybe our time is over."
"I did not want to do it. She seduced me into trying to kill thee! Yet even now, I cannot betray her..."
"Why ask me about them? I am a Ranger, not a Mage!"
"Oh, dear. Thou cannot possibly carry this much gold! Perhaps thou mayest return when thou hast dropped something else."
"If there is anything I can ever do for thee, return to Fawn, and I shall aid thee."
"If thou wouldst travel in a lighter fashion, thou wouldst have hands to take my gold!"
"The ether is flowing freely! Magic is with us once again!"
"Do not have much call for them. Not magic ones anyway. But I have made a few."
"Although our titles are different, I am equal in rank to SubCommander Tsandar."
"Many different species of animals reside in the forest. I have encountered some fascinating ones in my studies."
"Wouldst thou care for more?"
"To share tenets and material well-being."
"I am sorry. Thou must needs search for it thyself. I fear I cannot aid thee in this."
"My daughter Cantra is gone! I have looked everywhere for her. We need to send out a patrol!"
"I'd not be in thy shoes, good Pikeman. Retaking that tower will be as gruesome as the King of the White Dragon's castle."
"Wouldst thou be interested in buying or selling?"
"Of course!" He says, patronizingly. "How could I not recognize the great Iolo."
"Now where could that Batlin be? I suppose we shall have to have the meeting without him!"
"...he's a winsome lad."
"Yes, I am, though as of late I do not feel the music within me."
"It would be both an honor and a pleasure to join thee on thine adventures once again."
"But, of course! It must have been a teleportation storm!"
"Since thou dost not have enough room for this last item, it shall go at thy feet."
"I have not seen that Fellowship couple for many, many days. I have no idea where they could be now."
"Failure in ContStartOfTournament() because we couldn't find the door."
"Thou hast seen the Armour of Beauty! Oh, will the heavens never smile upon Fawn again?. I would that thou hadst brought it with thee."
"He is T-T-Tolemac's older br-br-brother. I t-t-trust him."
"It took a terrible toll on our boat, but if truth be told I have seen far worse."
As the gargoyle looks up at you, anger crosses his face. He stands quickly, overturning his drink.
"Thy thinking is more advanced than I had hoped! But surely, thou hast questions...?"
You see a nobleman in his forties who looks like either a politician or a well-dressed merchant.
"Thou couldst ask Ensorcio, they talked quite a bit. Or... I know... Thou canst look in the registry! 'Tis on the bar."
"Now, if only someone would turn Ducio into a workbench, it would be the most useful he's ever been!"
"I am a guardian of the Shrines of the Principles."
A stern-looking woman stares back at you without humor.
"Rocco could be killed easily, and spells are untraceable. Or he could be spirited away to hideous torture. No one would be the wiser."
"Well, should I just wait here or dost thou want me to go home to Trinsic?"
"Now that Lady Yelinda hath admitted my people within the city walls, we shall be safe from the goblins."
"I was never sufficiently forward or aggressive enough to be successful as a merchant but The Fellowship changed all that for me."
This is an elderly woman who epitomizes 'grandmotherly'.
"I was born in New Magincia and I have lived here mine entire life. But now I wish to leave for mine heart hath been broken."
You see a rough-looking man with a bitter expression on his face.
"Yes, very well, Vasel. I shall concede that point."
"Or wilt thou tell me the secret which I desire, the key to controlling Daemons!!!"
"Why dost thou trouble me now? Canst thou not see that I am very busy..."
"I perform music for those who would listen. Music is a difficult art."
"Then I cannot trust thee enough to tell thee of my plans. Go away."
"Ooooh, yuck!"
Day 8 -- This rotten place ain't for me. It don't seem possible to revel around here.
"Beatrix, is that thee?"
"To be excellent! To have seen him? To know how he is faring? To be well?"
"Avatar! Art thou all right? I heard what sounded like the explosions of a volcano -- and look at all the fire here..."
"But I know that I have to do it sometime. They are mine only hope of finding Edrin again."
"Couldst thou please make up thy mind!?"
"They had a secret cache of money and weapons hidden somewhere in the mountains west of town."
"My sister Selene was a very beautiful girl. She was four years older than I, and I thought she was so mature!"
"M'name's Kane. I be a sheepherder..." ~"I be waitin' for passage to Moonshade, if thou pleasest."
"The coins are thine!"
"Delin is Fawn's dry goods dealer, poor man. I wished Batlin luck in discussing anything with him."
"Oh, well. But I have so enjoyed our conversation!"
"Without the proper armaments, thou canst not seek the wisdom of the dead. Seek the Staff of the Serpent within the bowels of Furnace."
"Thou poisoned bad! I fix."
"I already sold thee my last banana!"
"Oh, I so enjoy meeting men who like to go out and 'kill' things!"
Listen carefully to these words and let those principles be with thee.
"Very well. Thou mayest resume, Captain Voldin."
"You are thanked."
"Next, thou shouldst engage the winch. This will seal thee within the tower, and activate the levers. It will also summon a magical storm."
"I knew that Edrin could not be so misled..."
"'Tis a life-size board game. I have a book around here somewhere which contains the rules."
"Lastly, I have absolute faith in the Priestess of Beauty... wherever she may be. She is too beautiful to be wrong!"
Once thou dost have the Forces of Order in thy life thou shouldst have no doubt.
"I can give thee 4 filari for every 3 guilders thou hast."
"The forefathers of all the people here were dissenters of Lord British's rule."
Fight to the death, but do not abandon thine Ethics.
You see a man with an unhappy look upon his face.
"Thank the heavens I have found thee! Thou didst disappear..."
"If thou wert to be at the Blue Boar Inn at 10 tonight, I could discuss these things further with thee..."
"Perhaps nothing can stop a Death Knight."
"What!" he appears stunned. "Died? How is that possible?"
"Failed... Duty... Punishment..."
"Thou canst find almost anything there. But remember, Bucia loves to talk. Don't say that I didn't warn thee."
"Her name is Judith. She's the music teacher at The Music Hall. Perhaps thou hast met her. We have a wonderful relationship."
"If only we could learn the secret of their hidden camp! But it remains a mystery..."
"Without love, we could not live in peace. If we did not have joy, life would be pointless."
"They were led by the weakling, Falcon. After they left, I never saw them again. Ah, well..."
"How darest thou interrupt the Ceremony! Dost thou not recognize the influence of Chaos in this place?"
"To be agreeable?"
"I fear that the witnesses might be tempted to spare my sensibilities, instead of reciting the bare facts."
"I wonder if this was the bottle that disappeared... Thou shouldst ask my commander about the wine."
"Thou shalt receive thy tattoo, and shalt wear the pelt of thy totem animal."
"Take heart for thy beloved Iolo is here!"
"Thou cannot carry that much of a load."
"Oh. Thou dost not have enough gold to buy the title."
"I fear, however, that she hath fallen under the spell of one of those infidels! Ruggs, I think his name is."
Thou shalt be clean when touching The Books.
"Avatar! Oh Avatar! I have news!"
"My fee will leave thee with nothing!"
"If thou art fond of thy life I would advise against venturing into Aram-Dol's domain."
"Thou shouldst stay out of this, woman..."
"This," he says, holding a solid-gold sheet shaped like a maple leaf, "I purchased at an auction for only half of its value."
"Dost thou suspect townsfolk, or strangers?"
"Dost thou not know a farm when thou dost see one?"
"It is all so obvious, if one thinks about it just so..."
"Petra looks after Rocco, and cooks for the inn. In fact, she serves the finest baked fish around. Thou shouldst try it some time."
"I shall not speak to thee until the Oracle hath ruled!"
"Why, I am famous throughout the land! Hast thou not heard of me?"
"It is a phoenix egg. It is obviously quite rare, and it possesses magical qualities that go beyond explanation."
"To have a branch here. To meet at usual time each night."
"May I... could I... wouldst thou mind if I kept this pair? No Mundane could ever own such finery!"
"The sawyer there is named William."
"Then thou shalt be doomed to never finish thy quest. Art thou sure? I give thee one more chance. Dost thou want to help?"
"I do not know what... it is, but there are many books in his house. Perhaps... there is something there about... magic."
"Mercy! This has taken far longer than I thought! Ye should be on yer way now..."
"Or if thou dost care to join me in a bottle of ale, I will gladly share with thee."
"Filari are Fawn's currency... A small silver disk with a colored gem in the center."
An expensive fur cap, which the MageLord of Moonshade obtained for one of his many lovers.
"Surely, thou dost not think that Leon the Preacher and Alyssand the Weaver have won? They don't have the strength to govern."
"Fenn is a beggar who refuses all aid from The Fellowship. A pathetic case. Not even his former friend Merrick can reach him any more."
"I surmise thou didst come across with the others."
"'Twas male, and had bright red skin. But there were no horns on its head -- I swear. I believe its name was Palos."
"I see I have reached the limits of thy sense of humor."
"Mine husband Klog is a wonderful branch leader. He is an inspiration to all of the Trinsic members."
"Thou shouldst go quickly to Julia -- the Rangers can solve crimes such as this!"
"Even thou mayest join The Fellowship and I can tell thee more about it."
"I am waitin' for passage to Moonshade, if thou pleasest."
"I must be near a Serpent Gate for the Amulet of Balance to work."
"Unleash the spell... NOW!"
"Brendann is more well-acquainted with finery of ladies than a simple farm woman such as I, I am afraid."
"He gives baskets of fruit free to The Fellowship without Lord British's consent, I am quite certain."
"As a Bear, I know that our Command is innocent. Caladin doth have many faults, but being devious is not one of them."
"Honey is favorite food of all Emps!"
"The Council represents what 'your' language defines as 'government'."
"It is good to determine an impression of others on one's own."
"Yes? Thou dost wish to say something to me?"
"What didst thou think of the Knight's Test? Didst thou have any harrowing experiences?"
"Remove that immediately!"
"Good for thee."
"Once again a local manifestation addresses the Xorinite dimension."
"The storms grew worse and worse! Food was scarce... And a strange sickness crept through the city like some silent predator."
"Take care with thy words, master woodsman."
"I cannot keep track of all who come and go in this place. Thou shouldst talk to Simon, he is the innkeeper here."
"Forgive me. I have no questions for thee."
"'Tis a blessing that thou and thine honored Pikemen companions did wrest the Fawn tower from the Goblins."
"Bucia may be able to tell thee if she sells anything like them. And who purchased them."
"I wish that the Council would give us the funds for arms like this!"
"And do not forget the enchanter who appeared in the midst of the funeral services for our deceased Pikemen!"
"Our traditions teach us that the statue is an infallible guide to Truth and Beauty."
"Oh, my. Thine hands are too full to take the title!"
"I smell something... thou hast some fish! Oh, I do so love a good fish."
"Thou shouldst not loiter about here. Thou must leave this place immediately."
"I must apologize to thee for the attack upon thee by the traitor, Shmed."
I believe that believing in Emotion will give me the ability to perceive feelings which come from the heart and not the mind.
"Hurry! Take Ice Dragon blood to Yenani! No time to delay!"
"Welcome to Fawn, the city of Beauty. I am Kylista, Priestess of Beauty."
"I have a book here that Adjhar said told about... our... creation. This might help bring Adjhar back."
"Let me know if thou dost change thy mind."
"Uhm... er... he is also a coordinator for executions and he cheats at cards."
"Although it was Rabindrinath's spell that trapped us within the Dream Realm, it is the Dream Crystal that keeps us from leaving."
"She is also a fine horticulturist and healer. I met her when I accompanied Batlin into town for supplies."
"If thou canst not pay for our goods, please say so..."
"I wish to welcome him as well as thee. Return when he is with thee!"
Day: I am still without food and whales... I seee but cannot... well hilp arrive in time!? I think but am thoughtful...
"Hmm..." ~"I suppose one must accept such a price -- though it could have been higher."
"They have slain him, and there is none to replace him. I do not know his burial spot. I weep for him."
"What dost thou wish, felon?"
"How wouldst thou characterize such behavior?"
"Xenka's visions were of the world's end, oh great one."
"One of Monitor's famed Pikemen! I am Kylista, Priestess of Beauty."
"Thou cannot possibly carry that much!"
"Here is thy deed."
"My name, good friend, is Batlin. And indeed it is truly a privilege to meet the Avatar in the flesh."
"Iieeeee.... Help me!" ~"I cannot escape..." ~"It will catch and devour me!" *"Canst thou not see it? Please, help me!"
"Thou art not ready to learn yet!"
"It hath been quite a while since I was so defeated!"
"Perhaps thou shouldst lighten thy load before taking the bomb."
"Am Gilwoyai, means @Of the Wind@."
"Wait. I almost forgot about this..."
"Hast thou seen Batlin? Where is he? He needs to lead our meeting!"
"There is much I have witnessed in these halls, but I am forbidden to speak of it."
"My cyclopean people say I am a hero. Many of you humans say I am a monster. No doubt, the truth is somewhere in between."
"What wouldst thou like to buy?"
You see the town bartender. She looks very busy, but she obviously takes pride in her work.
"Selina certainly isn't one of those over-dressed mages, for sure!" ~"She's too timid ta be anything but a servant."
"The Temple is the primary staging and training area for our efforts in this accursed war. It is the headquarters of the High Command."
"Thou shouldst bear in mind that their accounts are likely to be highly biased in their own favor."
"All right, then..."
"Why, 'tis Nystul!"
"I hope thou dost enjoy it..."
"Perhaps I could find another song for thee..."
"The Pikemen track them into the woods around their Knight's Test, west of here. Then they simply seem to disappear."
"What dost thou seek of me..." A pause, "Master?"
"And Torrissio, a fine young Mage with a burning ambition. He reads books and keeps to himself."
"To keep its secrets well guarded. To have slain all of our warriors who entered."
"I myself can only master the third level of spells. An Adept can master the ninth level of spells."
"Thy friend hath been taken! How foul! And by magical means! Indeed..."
"I would gladly give thee thy sextant but thou shalt have to put something down! Thou art carrying too much to take it."
"As a token of mine appreciation, I shall give thee the most valuable possession I could bestow upon thee."
He pours a glass of wine into a crystal goblet and takes a sip.
"Thou dost have stoneheart! Could I..."
"It is very confusing to read."
"I have not seen thee in Monitor before. Thou art new here. Welcome!"
"To wonder if you jest. To say you do not have the Goblet. To be unwilling to deal with you until you have gotten it."
Some creatures will attack at random or toward the weakest party member.
"I know they do good work here in town, but there is just something about them that makes me uncomfortable."
"Please do not hold me responsible for that travesty of justice! In Moonshade, one doth not contradict the MageLord!"
"Failure in CleanUpTournament() because we couldn't find the guard."
"To ask how to help you?"
"I hope thou dost enjoy it..."
"Wine! Praise the Virtues! I could use a drink right now..."
You see a jovial young man who gives you a friendly greeting.
"Fortunately, he was honored by a clean death in battle before anyone could question the strictness of his command."
"Thou art too kind, Lady! I thank thee, and shall give it to Gwenno upon our reunion!"
"How nice. Thou hast returned to me. Hast thou brought the ring?"
"Wouldst thou like to hear the gold joke again?"
"Wilt thou give me a bit of money?"
"Buccaneer's Den must be a wonderland. There is a spinning wheel that gives thee money! Canst thou imagine! And opulent, luxurious baths."
"I understand now why Hawk did not wish to sail the open seas. I do not know how thou wilt leave this island... Unless the tales are true."
"Marsten sought to betray Bull Tower! We must act quickly to warn the Tower."
"I do not know anything about that."
"Luther brings me leopard pelts now and again, but mostly I must rely on the trappers to bring me exotic furs."
"Thou art already as proficient as I! I am afraid that thou cannot be trained further by me!"
"From success in tournament and in battle, the Knight Champion is determined. He or she is privileged to wear the Helm of Monitor."
"As thou canst see, Fawn is built upon the water. We are... or were... fishermen by trade."
"There is so little time in this life, and 'twould be an utter waste for someone of mine artistic abilities to engage in duels."
"To apply an optimistic order of thought through the Triad of Inner Strength."
"I tremble before the Hero from Another World! Thou art even as Xenka said!"
"I study the local flora, fauna, and geography here at the monastery."
"Come nearer, that I may boast of my deeds before I die."
"Yes, of course... Captain."
"The water is guaranteed to be pure, warm and cleansing."
"We should be very afraid, all of us..."
"He is a fine lad, always willing to give us a hand. Unlike that rude urchin, Garritt."
"Well, do not stare at me like that. I be innocent. They've never convicted me of any crimes..."
"To do odd jobs for others. Also, to record gargoyle legends in written form."
"Then perhaps thou art the thief! I shall not speak with thee further!"
"Then ask of me again, and I shall explain once more."
"Soon after Henry left carrying the locket, I saw the three strangers on the island, wandering off in the same direction."
"He was a very nice gargoyle. He helped Father a lot and did tasks in the stables. I cannot think why anyone would want to kill him!"
"Which coin dost thou care to exchange for guilders?"
"I am a member of the Artist's Guild in Minoc. I make and sell candelabras."
"Of which service dost thou have need?"
"Now then, how may I help thee?"
"And with the miracle weapons in our hidden arsenal, not even the Goblins could have taken this city..."
"And it would have worked if thou hadst not put a stop to their plans."
"I doubt he would believe even his own death, let alone care."
"Thou dost not have a spellbook."
"Before I tell thee what it is, wilt thou promise to take me and my mates back to Buccaneer's Den?"
The ape-like creature slowly and cautiously walks up to you. He, or she, sniffs for a moment, and then points to the honey you are carrying.
"Also, thou couldst speak with little Cantra. She is preparing to take the Test next month, and is full of information."
"Lady Yelinda should have ordered him executed for the woes that he hath brought upon our city!"
"To have not enough gold for that!"
"Thou art carrying too much to take the room key!"
"Farewell."
"I am sure we have something here that will be to thy liking."
"Imagine if women were not coddled or thought of as inferior! What would the world be like if we all listened to our Inner Voice?"
"I am the Lizard King. I can do anything."
"This is not the time for idle chat, good man. My life is at stake!"
"I shall proclaim whatever thou dost instruct me to proclaim. What dost thou wish me to say regarding the accused traitor, Master?"
"To find Ice Dragon lair walk north. Take ice raft to cross channel. Beware front opening!"
"Good! Poison gone now."
"Thou hast made it this far... Dost thou wish to purchase food or healing potions?"
"Thou wert wise to follow the advise of the townsfolk in coming to me -- "
"I shall just remain here alone and destitute! Where is my dagger? I shall slit my throat!!"
"Sorry, all bets are off, due to the... er, unfortunate passing on of one or more of the parties involved."
"On my farm I raise chickens and grow vegetables. If thou dost need work, talk to me!"
"As long as those humans stay out of my domain I shall reciprocate by not trespassing upon theirs."
"What dost thou want, if thou dost not want to beat me?"
"I'll simply say that I am mighty glad that my Petra is metal. That alone may keep her safe from his wandering eye."
"And due to mine intervention, the MageLord shall be glad to speak with thee. Please, go to him soonest!"
"My pleasure..."
"The Rangers of Moonshade make wine. Perhaps it is from there that this wine thou dost speak of hath come."
"Let me know if thou dost wish to buy anything."
"I can give thee 400 filari for any piece of jewelry thou hast."
"To be blunt, there is something uncommonly... erotic about thee. I am most attracted to thee, woman."
"The Guardian said that Balance could never be restored now. He said that the land will soon destroy itself... And us with it."
"Welcome, Knight. I must be about my duties."
"Go thou and see Delphynia, the horticulturist in Fawn. Perhaps she will have a supply of leaves."
"The cost is 12 guilders per person. Wouldst thou like a room for the night?"
"Alyssand's the daughter of Delin, the shopkeeper. Thou mightest think she hath had enough sadness in her short life."
"She is Cador's wife."
"Oh, art thou bothering me again! No servant of Beast British is welcome here."
"I charge 50 filari to use my knowledge of herbs to attempt to heal. Dost thou agree to pay?"
"Which coin dost thou care to exchange for monetari?"
"But I did not take it, for it belongs to the Lady. And the rats shall not disturb it."
"Fruits and vegetables are our favorites. Many are sweet."
You see a friendly-looking farmer.
"I am too young to have a job. I am a gypsy as my parents vere gypsies. I am also a member of The Fellowship."
"Oh, foul betrayal! Number 4 murdered me and took the key!"
"Her skin is smooth and soft. Finer than any luxuriant mane or hide thou wilt find in her shop, I can assure thee... Harrumph, excuse me!"
"A trapper named Hazard sells me snow leopard pelts. Unfortunately, his men only make it as far south as Monitor a few times a year."
"I believe his name is Tolemac. He is a farmer, from what I have heard. Phearcy would know more than I. Or thou couldst ask their clerk."
"See for thyself, the posted bills for known villains are in the log book in the courtroom."
"I knew that thou wouldst need me to unravel the mess that these monks have made of my prophecies."
"Can I bring thee something?"
"And the experiment that thou didst carry out for me seems to confirm what I believed to be true."
"My fee will leave thee with nothing!"
"That is too bad. I believe thou wouldst be perfect for the office."
"'Tis sweet of thee to agree to this price, love..."
"I am Tobias. I suppose I am to believe thou art someone important."
"Oh. Thou dost not have the room. Too bad."
"Ah, dear Nastassia. Wouldst thou like to hear her tale?"
"I thank thee for cremating that once proud warrior."
"Rhys knew that some mystics were truth-tellers and some were not."
"A freak change of wind cast his ship aground and he was trapped in the rigging."
"The Lady of Fawn gave me this necklace to give to thee, when at last I found thee, my love."
"Thou canst not afford the lute!"
"Since the poison hath not killed thee, I see that I must do the job myself!"
"Thou must play The Game if thou dost want to speak with me."
"Wouldst thou care for more?"
"Wouldst thou like something else?"
"My body is covered with tattoos! My mother tattooed my back and other spots I could not reach comfortably."
"Yes, that is the proper direction to travel, Avatar."
"And that scholar -- a woman with fine bone structure, but a little too old to pleasure me..."
"The ether is repaired. The mages of the world are indebted to thee."
"Thou dost know her! She and I are the closest of friends. She stayed here for many weeks."
"I mean no disrespect, but I have never heard of @the Avatar@ before."
"I must be mistaken. Farewell."
You tell Sprellic that the situation has been resolved and how it was done.
"That one I do not like a bit. I do not trust him. He reminds me of those gargoyles."
"Be careful, mate, lest thou be mistaken for an honest seafarin' man."
"They all bore the mark of some serpent design or another. I noted that there appeared to be a different serpent motif in different areas."
"To be called Aurvidlem. To recognize you to be the Avatar."
"Then it is imperative that we find a way to bring him back! If nothing else, I owe him my gratitude."
"Why, 'tis duelling! At twelve noon every day, the town square becomes a battlefield."
This lovely actress is dressed in a mouse costume.
"Thou hast been beaten, as was expected. Though thou art insignificant, try to remember the lessons I have taught thee this day."
"That cantankerous man runs the tavern, the Keg Of Spirits. Thou canst find it near the ferry dock."
"Thou cannot travel with that much!"
"Whom dost thou wish ta know about?"
"Mine instincts tell me this man is lying, Avatar!"
"Pothos is back, and his shop is open once again."
"I offer only the finest merchandise at the fairest prices!"
"To purchase what item?"
Your mind is quickly probed, then cast aside, leaving you feeling slightly ill and filled with an irrational sense of forboding.
"Petre, the stables caretaker, discovered poor Christopher and Inamo early this morning."
"Wouldst thou care for more?"
"Thou dost not have anything that I care to purchase!"
"No? Well, let me know if thou art in the future. Perhaps thou couldst help me."
"Actually, I believe they are on their way to the Isle of the Avatar to take care of our new Special Project."
"Why, 'tis my job to train the many who visit Yew to become more agile."
"There are many in this town who would like to steal her from Melino, but none hath succeeded!"
"I can only accept gold coins. I hope that is acceptable with thee."
"The cost is 5 monetari per person. Wouldst thou like a room for the night?"
"And where are thy clothes?"
"He was a brilliant and respected mage. But something happened to him in recent years. He seemed to go completely senile."
"Lay down thine arms, Knights! Such fighting belongs on the List Field, not in the banquet hall."
"It looks to be one of the Serpent Teeth that Mad Erstam used to collect."
"I cannot give thee anything I find while exploring. If I give thee anything, thou wilt lose the Game."
"The activities of the retreat consist of philosophical training and studies."
"Thou art truly the one I seek! Here is the Hourglass of Fate. Keep it with thee always, for through it the Monks of Xenka can aid thee."
"But I should let Iolo tell thee..."
Lord British rolls his eyes. "Must we go through this formality?" He laughs, shaking his head.
"Welcome, good Pikeman. Thy presence honors us." *"I am Great Captain Voldin."
"I do not know to whom this belongs, but it is not mine."
"Actually, this will be my debut theatrical performance. I have been working as a barmaid waiting for my first chance to be in the theatre."
"He is the fighting instructor. In his spare time, he likes to make swords. Menion has been kind enough to give me one of his creations."
"I am a farmer, though most folks just call me a lunatic."
"I cannot build thee a ship as I suspect we both know."
"To be all right."
You see a solid-looking but seemingly bored fighter.
"I demand that this criminal be punished by the Council of Mages. Let the quorum of Mages be convened instantly!"
"If thou wilt aid me with mine experiments involving the teleport storms, I shall reward thee with magic. Dost thou agree?"
"What spell dost thou wish to buy?"
"So please, do not tell anyone! Dost thou desire to know about townsfolk, or visitors?"
"I tried. But these storms have brought fierce monsters into that area... And I'm no Adept to deal with them."
"I found the wreckage. Three men were clinging to it for their lives."
"Thou must honor thy duty. I apologize for speaking ill of a honorable warrior such as thyself."
"Lies! Number 3 will remember that we were together when Number 7 disappeared!"
"If thou art not with The Fellowship thou art against them. I think they saw me as a potential enemy that had to be stopped."
"I will say that the trial is corrupted, and I shall denounce the true traitors."
"I am sorry, but thou dost not have enough guilders to purchase this!"
"One that I shall pay, worry thou not!"
"To know many gargoyles. To want to know about some of them?"
"Thy friend hath been taken! By means magical! 'Tis an offense to the Council..."
"I do not think I can assist thee, but if I think of anything, I will let thee know!"
"What a strange request... Yes, I can make thee a Worm Gem, if thou dost desire."
"Thou wert our only hope, Avatar. Our souls are trapped here, unable to go to what awaits beyond the realm of life."
"I can think of no better place in all of Trinsic to lay thine head to rest or to nibble upon treats to satisfy thine appetite."
"Dost thou find this price acceptable?"
"What spell art thou interested in buying?"
"Again, welcome! Might I be able to help thee today?"
"Good day to thee, Avatar."
"Whom dost thou wish to heal?"
One of the common shields used by the Pikemen of Monitor.
"Hmmm. Dost thou merely want me to wait here or dost thou want me to go home?"
"How may I help thee? I am Widow Harnna, the Healer of Monitor. I also grow mine own food."
"In the end, 'tis either Men or Goblins -- both of us cannot dwell here."
"Krayg is the most likely suspect, as thou didst hear Luther proclaim at the banquet."
"Thou hast not the room for this meat."
"I can give thee 2 filari for every 1 gold coin thou hast."
"I never said that thou needs must like me. I said that I had to aid thee. Dost thou wish to hear it or not?"
"Oh. Thou dost not have enough gold to buy the title."
"My fee will leave thee with nothing!"
"In fact, if we escape, I suggest that thou shouldst acquire as many spell scrolls as thou canst -- they come in very handy!"
"Perhaps some other time, then."
"Would that I had more stock, that I might make a better deal!"
"Actually, there is a very good reason why I am a baker."
"Iolo hath struck up a friendship with the Mage Gustacio, from whom he is learning much about the storms which plague this land."
"I am certain Father would not approve of such a deal."
"If the bottle is of an uncommon type, then perhaps that would be a clue."
"Xanthia is a very talented young woman. She makes very elaborate and distinctive candelabras."
"I can see by dat medallion thou dost vear dat thou hast snuck into dis place by disguising thyself as vone of dem. Very clever, Avatar!"
"Of course she took it! Wilt thou give me the Comb? I will grant thee Fawn's greatest treasure, as I promised the heavens."
"Batlin called him Palos. And the daemon went about meekly hooded and robed as his master commanded."
"From the look in thine eye I can see that this is far from over. Truly this is farewell, Avatar."
"I am right enough, Shazzana. And I cannot rest until I have aired my concerns."
You see a beggar. You cannot tell from the look on his face whether he is about to laugh or cry.
"Dost thou think that the mighty Mages deal with every thief or common brawler? Certainly not!"
"The phoenix are creatures of fate. We are naturally drawn to places where the balance between Order and Chaos hath been upset."
"He is the son of Feridwyn and Brita, who run the shelter. Garritt crosses the road to avoid us."
"Yvella is a lovely woman. She spends her days caring for their daughter, Catherine."
"We did pass through an illusionary wall to enter that cave. Might there be another leading deeper inside the mountain?"
"Spark, the poor brave lad, is no longer with us. We should endeavor to get his body to a healer so he may be revived."
"Oh, if I were better at this, perhaps I could make more monetari."
"Dost thou wish to begin the test?"
"Renown follows those who travel with the Avatar. I thank thee."
"Well, between thee and me, I think that he hath aged much more than I!"
"Thy loss..."
"All right, honey. Whatever heats thy blood..."
"Thou shalt find King's Savior growing near mushrooms, along the western shore of this land, beyond the mountain ridge."
"To be agreeable?"
You see Julia, a member of your party of adventurers from one of your previous visits to Britannia.
"Thou wilt not be travelling to Cove at all? Well, all right then. Never mind."
"Thou must play The Game to get the clue!"
"Very well. I will have to save it for when I have time to talk with her. Thank thee anyway."
"Who art thou?" Rudyom asks. "Oh -- I remember."
You see a man whose boyish face is set with scrutinizing eyes that look as if they have seen much.
"She demanded that our love-making be done in secret, and so I built a secluded love palace."
"Pothos and I must speak privately concerning important matters of state. I thank thee all for coming!"
"I will train thee now."
"We were... fashioned... out of the rock from the quarry on this small island."
"The only other living soul is one I turned away -- One I deemed unworthy of Fawn's Beauty!"
"Perhaps our good name was degraded by those wishing to stop our ministering... But that shows a lack of Trust."
"Then thou shouldst go immediately to see Batlin at the Fellowship Hall headquarters in Britain."
"My name is Beverlea."
"Thou dost already have that spell!"
"Oh! I feel so much better! The pain is ebbing. Now we may converse much more easily."
"But let me say this -- Batlin shall not rest in peace, for a powerful warrior is on his trail!"
"What an ugly rock. Take that with thee when thou leavest, please?"
"Thou hast not enough gold for that!"
"Besides, I do not drink that brew. 'Tis Fawnish ale. A bitter brew!"
"Seek out the one whose Beauty lies deep within. He will set thee upon the path to the lost soul of Fawn."
Shamino looks relieved. "I am -so- glad thou didst ask me that." He gathers his gear and prepares to follow you.
"But I cannot, master."
"Batlin bade Leon stay and preach to the populace of Fawn and left the ship with three companions: Palos, Brunt and Deadeye."
"Yet we both can sense the messages from the Void Between the Worlds. The wisdom of the Great Earth Serpent..."
"I am glad I do not look as aged as -he- does!"
"Honey will be given by you to me?"
"Such a one did come through here, perhaps two months ago."
"I find it hard to believe that Iolo could be guilty of Daemonism, yet be wed to such a wonderful lady."
"Perhaps thou wouldst show it to me later."
"We of Gwani overjoyed to learn Gwenno's resurrection."
"Its defense, as thou dost know, is an unusual Moongate."
"Thy part is done. Go thy way, continue thy quest -- we of the Cause shall struggle on without thee."
"Avatar! I was just alerted of thy presence in our fair city! I have been expecting thee!"
"At present my shop is closed. If thou wilt come back during business hours I shall be more than happy to help thee."
"Speaking of thy friends, I have heard that thy companion, Dupre, is a drunken sot."
"Where to start?"
"A pity we could not teach that little fool a lesson. Still, we have regained our honor and that is enough. For now."
"I understand thou didst determine that the traitor in our town was Simon. I am certain thou didst deal properly with him."
"My fee will leave thee with nothing!"
"All right."
"I am a heavy sleeper, so thou shalt most likely have to awaken me..."
"Thurston owns the mill. He could do better if he ran his business with more of an eye toward profit."
"Wilfred is Argus' younger brother..."
"And The Fellowship is again openly admitted within the city! I know not what to think."
"My fee will leave thee with nothing!"
"We thought them poor, confused seamen worthy of our embrace. But we were fooled! All they brought were lies!"
This is an attractive young woman who seems sad.
"I am here to guard...." He pauses, obviously deep in thought."I am without a duty now."
"We have berries, pumpkins and other vegetables. Thou mayest take some, if thou dost wish."
"This is not honorable! I do not have time to play games with thee! Begone!"
"Thou didst find the venom vial in Garritt's belongings? I am amazed! I am astonished! I am-- sorry."
"The coins are thine!"
"What didst thou say?!"
"If thou dost not have the scroll, I cannot help thee in this matter."
"I am Brownie."
"And I have special plans for the Avatar...!"
"Perhaps another time then."
"Ah, the learned scholars. I can tell thee about Brion, Nelson, Zelda, and Jillian."
"I can hardly speak of the Champion Knight without remembering Astrid's foul death at the hands of the Goblins."
"Again, welcome! As thou canst see, Master Ducio is not here at present. Perhaps I can help thee."
"I see that thou art still hale and whole, Avatar!"
"Perhaps if thou couldst provide the 30 guilders which a proper investigation costs...?"
Martine takes a deep breath, then smiles.
"What dost thou need?"
"Until thy friend's innocence or guilt hath been proven, Avatar, we may not speak together."
"Don't let me discourage thee from making the attempt to slay the thing. My life depends on it, friend!"
"Yes, master."
"I take care of my daughter, Catherine, while Cador is at work."
"Gwenno dead. She good woman. Very generous. She once make gift of bucket to Baiyanda. Baiyanda place body at sacred Gwani Death Temple."
"A blue egg? I have never heard of such a thing, but the Magister is wise in many subjects. Perhaps thou shouldst inquire of Fedabiblio."
"I am Lydia, the tattoo artist."
"Remember always -- knowledge is power."
"He is the Goblin leader -- a king or a chieftain, depending on how one translates the Goblin tongue."
"Thou dost not have enough gold for that!"
"At last, the values of The Fellowship have reached into the ranks of the Pikemen! I am honored."
"I am the greatest actor who ever lived," he proclaims with absolutely no modesty. "I am playing the character 'Iolo' in the new play."
"Found this object when I happened to be passing through one of the manors, if thou knowest what I mean..."
"Knight Champion is the most revered title in Monitor -- more than Lord! To be Knight Champion is to be the finest warrior in the land."
"I was caught in a great battle. The powerful magic the soldiers unleashed left my soul caught here in this wall."
"Until thou hast proven thyself, he shall have little to do with thee."
"I call the Lady Yelinda to witness before the Oracle."
"Dost thou think me a fool, to argue with me only to change thy mind? I shall spread the word about thee in this town, wait and see!"
"The Guardian said to tell thee that he was changing the venue..."
"Thy friends will have to help carry these things."
"To be master of the Recreation Facility and Learning Center. To be in charge of much information valuable to the gargoyle race."
"To not be able to save them. To give them a proper burial for you."
"The Helm was originally taken from the old goblin king, Gurnordir, in the days of the Goblin Horde."
"Hello again."
"I do not have time to repeat everything again! Go thou and ask young Cantra -- she hath nothing better to do."
"Thou art a shrewd and crafty bargainer, to convince me to accept this price..."
"Feel free to look at anything in the library, even if I am attending to my chores."
"Call me Boris."
"Anything else ye want?"
"Remember, death is a dreamer's fiery door to life."
"Yes, I have a name."
"Some other evening, perhaps."
"Why dost thou interrupt? I am a Pikeman of Monitor."
"Avatar! I have found a most intriguing scroll that tells of some sort of mystic connection between the Banes and the ancient temples!"
"Perhaps thou couldst call it a 'confident philosophy'. We meet here at the branch office every night."
"I do not know why, but I accept thine offer. Thou dost bargain well, friend."
"Worse yet, he doth admit allegiance to that archfiend, Beast British!"
"Dost thou believe in magic?"
"I am afraid that I have forgotten. Thou must understand, I have been dead a very long time."
"It is she who possesses the youth and beauty I held dear not long ago. But ask whether love passes between us and I will tell thee nay."
"The world shall quail before me! Wrong shall become right! And right shall become lost! Nothing shall escape my touch!"
"Thou shouldst ask Fedabiblio for the key. I am sure he will give it to thee since thou didst save him."
"In this I am unique, for none of the other automatons claim to feel emotions as I do. But I do not know why I should be different."
"Yes, master..."
"A sturdy lad, Keth was. 'Twere a pity ta lose him."
"Ah... art thou one of my daughter's friends? I cannot seem to recall thee..."
"Very well... then I shall play no more."
"But please come again sometime!"
I See the Hero From Another World strike...
"Fawn is a coastal town filled with the worshippers of beauty. Frankly, I find those people to be a little too superficial for my liking."
"It doth cause me to wonder why anyone in the city of Mages would buy the rough stockings I make when they could purchase ones so soft."
"Avatar! Because thou didst keep thy promise to release me"
"Do I detect a note of disapproval? Well, I don't have to take that from anyone!"
"Do not mock the Oracle, stranger."
"This stocking might be a clue to her strange disappearance! Thou shouldst take this to the Chief Ranger!"
"Allow me to see what thou hast -- it had better not be one of mine own!"
"Er... try talking to him."
"Well, I must say that I find him likable. He does his duty without blabbering all the time."
"Thou couldst try asking Bucia, though. If anyone might know where these slippers came from, it would be her."
This is a woman who seems pleasant and welcoming. "I am proud to meet the Avatar," she says, beaming.
"The only other thing I ever heard from those mages that made sense is that a dragon turns very hostile if its mate or young is killed."
"A modest amount. Not bad..."
"Thou dost not have enough money."
"I sought to win her away from her foolishness by rational argument. Regrettably, it became a test of magics."
"That is the tavern here in Vesper. Yongi's the barkeeper. He serves a passing fair tankard of ale."
"Let me have it! Alyssand must hear of this."
"And I'm the kind of friend who could keep thee warm on a cold winter's night. Not like that thin-framed weaver wench."
"Then we shall find the secret of his power, and prevent him from stopping mine escape!"
"About whom dost thou wish to inquire?"
"We are beset by dragons, Avatar! We must slay them quickly!"
"Art thou a Master?"
"Why, Andrio will not even pass his house before 9 in the morning."
"Good. I would hate for thee to have lost it..."
"Thou dost not know of the Magister? The Mage who comes in the night and steals our children away?"
"They've put me in here to rot, they have!"
"...but never bring that object here again!"
"Anyway, as I was saying, uhm, what was I saying? Oh yes. Magic. I can still sell thee some spells or reagents if thou wouldst like."
"Wilt thou agree to my rate?"
"Thy companions will have to help thee carry some of these things."
"To be the seller of provisions."
You see a middle-aged man with a furrowed brow, as if he is constantly worried.
"Brendann is their lord. The Wolves are smart, preferring cunning over brute force."
"It sounds like thou art describing a hairbrush used by the goblins. It is fashioned out of human bone..."
"Thou canst see for thyself... There is no way out of here. I can find no concealed doors."
"Yes, yes! It all fits now! She admired it greatly, and seemed a bit offended when I did not offer it to her..."
"I can give thee 2 gold coins for every 3 guilders thou hast."
"Thou dost not have enough coin to pay for that!"
"If ye say so. I know that blasted Britannian Tax Council or what have ye has made the cost o' things too high! Maybe next time!"
"Sorry, but I cannot help thee until I return to my desk. All the paperwork that I have to fill out is there."
"He went west from here, towards the magic woods."
"Thou dost possess the Serpent Armour... fine, fine. It is more than a symbol of the Great Earth Serpent's power."
"Now Voldin is truly what Fawn needs as an advisor! His record of service on land and sea is impeccable."
"Due to the dangers of the magical storms, the ships no longer come."
"I miss the flesh! There were pains and sorrow, but it was far better than this joyless life."
The golem seems to have regained his staid composure. However, life is still evident within his gem-like eyes.
"She is the most beautiful woman in town..."
"Perhaps if I could see the slippers I could tell thee more about them..."
"Aye, we have something here that'll fill thy belly."
"Ah, I see that thou art a Knight of Monitor!"
"To be gone -- dead -- now."
"They brought thee here along their way to Buccaneer's Den."
"For my part, I can say that I was with Number 2 and Number 6 when last we saw Number 7."
"I despise pattern, and disrespect all laws, and I prize mine individuality above all else!"
"Hast thou in thy possesion the book on the Stone of Castambre?"
"We know not for certain from where thou wilt continue..."
"I Grod. Why you want know? Is voice unhappy?"
"Ah, my sweet... Thou hast a very quick wit to bargain me so low. Are other parts of thee as well-equipped as thy tongue?"
"Surely, these belong to no one in this city. Krayg the provisioner might know who would sell something like these slippers."
"I would be more than happy to sell thee some cheese, but for now the dairy is closed."
"They appear to be coins from another town. Spektor would recognize them, I am certain."
You see a cheerful, handsome young man who gives you a friendly wave as you approach.
"Normally I would never accept such an offer, but who do I have to train here? I hope this war ends soon..."
"Only Fedabiblio had the key. But now he hath been turned to stone!"
"They are just beyond the curtain in the crematorium."
"To be sorry that we have lost Runeb. Perhaps to be for the best. To be certainly overjoyed to have avoided damage to the altars."
"What didst thou find?"
"To understand."
"Some other time, then."
"Yes, yes, thou art very kind, but I am sure there are much more important matters thou must attend to. I thank thee none the less."
"Perhaps thou knowest of Gorn. He speaks with a most peculiar accent!"
"Odd that they did not stop after the heretics were banished from the city. I shall have to consult Kylista."
"I am a Fawn Guardsman! Thou wouldst do well to stay out of mischief while visiting our city!"
"Please come by the pub sometime."
"Yes, my wife, Yvella, and my daughter, Catherine."
"If thou art in need of a ship I hold the deed to a fine one. Thou wilt also need a sextant to help steer her true."
"She shall only extort a bribe, then send thee elsewhere."
"You are not going to trust the Time Lord are you? Careful, my friend -- do not believe him!"
"He did ask me about strange objects, such as I had never heard of. They weren't normal items, sir!"
"That looks like the key to Father's chest. I wondered where it was!"
"Thou must seek out a Mage to aid thee, if there are any left among the living..."
"Yet I cannot believe that she'd betray her entire city to the Goblins. Impossible!"
"No one would interfere with thy communion with the waters of Logic."
"Namely, those who belong to the organization called The Fellowship, which doth dare to preach contrary to Beauty."
"I have already given thee my permission. Go! Do not trouble me further! I can do no more in this matter."
"We meet again, I see."
"I am working on securing that appointment for thee to meet with the MageLord, but these things take time..."
"Please make up thy mind!"
"But it hath been stolen!"
"'Xorinia' recognizes 'your' usefulness. 'I' shall be here. Human entities will call 'my' activity 'waiting'."
"I fear that there is none worthy to fill her shoes as Champion Knight!"
You see a gorgeous and voluptuous woman in her thirties.
You see a very authoritative-looking older man who looks at you with thoughtful concern.
"How many clans divide the city of Monitor?"
"It is a pleasure to meet thee. I am Great Captain Voldin." *"Fawn is in sore need of more men to help hold the Goblins at bay."
"According to legend, the Oracle was brought by our ancestors from Sosaria, our homeland. It now stands in the Temple of Beauty."
"Please come to the shop during normal business hours."
"How may I help thee now? Dost thou have need of healing, or dost thou wish to buy my vegetables?"
"Then we shall find the secret of his power, and prevent him from stopping mine escape."
"I remember thee."
"If thou dost not leave quickly, I must call the Rangers!"
"Thou art welcome."
"We do not believe that truth only serves those in power... we think that someone hath corrupted the Oracle!"
"Do not venture into the cave which thou wilt find inside the barrier. The cave is off-limits to attendees."
"Of course not! Thou art a man of the world. Thou knowest that thou canst acquire only what thou takest."
"His business hath certainly benefitted from Petra's skills. Petra is one of the finest cooks in the city."
You see a young gypsy lad. He is wearing a Fellowship medallion. His eyes look down and his expression is one of extreme sorrow.
"Ah, the ladies of Monitor. All are governed by their own particular passions."
"There is love and hatred, despair and joy. Without these, Men would cease to be Men."
"I shall go to the Forest Master and beg for a place by his side. He is old, and doth need a help from time to time."
"Oh, was that strange armour that appeared in my bedchamber thine?"
"To know nothing about that!"
"To see you already have that spell."
"Please spare me! I shall do anything! I do not want to be roasted over a goblin's fire..."
"Thou art worthy of Knighthood!"
"Do not deny it, fiend! I know how thy mind works. Even now, thou doth lust to topple the altar of this temple."
"Moonshade is nothing more than a city of mages. Who needs magic? It pales before a sharply honed sword."
"It does not matter whether thou art male or female! No, it does not! I shall kiss thee anyway!"
"Since I have joined thee, I will not ask for mine usual fee!"
"Look around thee! Dost thou see the needles, the vials of ink, and the sketches!"
"To desire a world where humans and gargoyles could live together in peace as equals in Britannian society."
"My thanks to thee, Katrina."
"I would never agree to such a price, if times were not so bad!"
"As for Shade, it stands for shelter against the cruel light of Honesty. We believe in Truth here, but only within reason."
"If that is what thou dost desire..."
"Then perhaps thou wouldst prefer ta hear a tale of a timeless love story that crosses the frozen wastes."
"Well, they mean nothing to me now that thou art in my life."
This certificate entitles the bearer to commit thievery up to a maximum of one hour.~~Shamino the Anarch.
"The lightning doth have the power to kill or to teleport, and sometimes it changes the nature of that which it strikes."
"I can give thee 4 filari for every 1 monetari thou hast."
"Garth is no more than a boy! He blows with the wind of anything that catches his fancy, most notably young ladies."
"Kristy, like Nicholas, is one of our orphans. She was found in an abandoned home in Paws by one of the Great Council members."
"If it is stockings thou seekest..."
"Thou hath solved my first three riddles. Doth thou wish to try a more dificult one?"
"The three values of the Triad of Inner Strength are Strive For Unity, Trust Thy Brother and Worthiness Precedes Reward."
"I can give thee 1 monetari for every 4 filari thou hast."
"Trolls have powerful ally. He warn us in head when trouble around corner."
"To trust him as far as I could throw him, and to certainly throw him as far as I could."
"Frankly, I'm not much of a fighter, even though I am a Knight."
Thou shalt be pure when reading The Books.
"What wouldst thou like to buy?"
"We are the Souls of Chaos, the spirits condemned to prowl these corridors until Chaos is restored."
"Then die, Spawn of Chaos!"
"Such a clever threat, girl! Dost thou not realize that thou dost live at my pleasure?"
Need to throw more wood in the fire.
"Chaos is the strong limb, and it cannot be beaten. It is like a rope made of many strands, many yet unified."
"If thou hast any questions about The Fellowship, Balayna can answer them."
"Wilt thou carry a letter back to Ruggs for me?"
I will finish this entry later tonight.
"As for the Wolves and the Bears, they are like children. "
"Wouldst thou speak with Lord British about me? I would bet that he is completely unaware of my case! Please! Wilt thou speak with him?"
"To be not my true name. To have been given this name by Cairbre, who could not pronounce my Gargish name."
"Thine hands are too full to take the bill!"
"Wouldst thou care for more?"
"Frighten such an adventurous wench? Now where was I? Oh, yes..."
"He is the supreme MageLord of the city of Moonshade."
"I had hoped to be able to speak with her about her time with the Ice People. It would be most instructive, I am sure."
"It pains me to agree... But what else can I do?"
"A blue egg? I have never heard of a blue egg."
"Simon the Innkeeper heard the sage say that he had come here from Fawn."
"Very well, but there is no reason for the Lady to take the stand. She may speak from where she is."
"Fine then. Thou art on thine own."
"I do not know who `they' are, but that is what they say, is it not?"
"'Twill cost thee 3 gold each. Still interested?"
"No one knows where their home is. Templar is our local Goblin expert, so thou shouldst speak with him."
"Crime most foul, most horrible!"
"Trellek is my husband."
"I've sold fur caps and cloaks from time to time, but the storms have isolated us from the Trappers. So I have none left to sell!"
"I have no job for I am a beggar. For a gold coin I shall tell thee a joke."
"Surely thou dost not want to listen to old war stories?! I have seen my share of death and destruction. Leave it at that."
"Thou mayest find the book upon the altar within the Chapel."
Day 5: ...
The ape-like creature slowly and cautiously walks up to you. He, or she, sniffs for a moment, and then points to the honey you are carrying.
"I shall meditate further on this matter."
"Ugh! Thou hast the manners of a man -- if not a goblin, to offer a girl such a pitiful sum!"
"Thoxa is a very bright young woman, who would like to feel that she hath single-handedly saved the world."
"Now that he hath dared to show his face again, it shall be him who is destroyed. Columna and I have already seen to that!"
"That key opened my Father's chest, did it not?"
"How many sets of twelve wouldst thou like?"
"My rates are the same as every other moneychanger..."
"I do not know anything about the stolen venom. I am falsely accused!"
"Bucia runs Flindo's shop for him. 'Tis called the Capessi Canton -- a pompous name, if thou dost ask me."
"Greetings, great hunter."
"Surely thou hast heard of The Fellowship, a most foul and evil organization. It has even infested the lovely forest of Yew!"
"Do not be surprised if most people do not talk to thee! Since thou art not a Knight of Monitor, thou dost not belong here."
You are wary of conversing with that trickster Chuckles, but decide to anyway.
"They say that that new shield of his doth have special powers, so that now he is truly invincible!"
Lord British hands you his Orb of the Moons.
"Thou mayest find lodgings at the Blue Boar. Thou shouldst see the Winery. And there's the artist's bazaar..."
"A secret! A secret! I have a secret! And I won't tell!"
"Julia is a Ranger at the Winery. She is a rather handsome woman. Very no-nonsense sort."
"It is of no use to thee now, unless thou dost want to summon me again."
"So what do I care if thou didst find garbage in the woods?"
"To be friends with Lap-Lem, and know he is a good miner. Also to know Ansikart, who reminds us of Singularity in these troubled times."
"If thou dost need a trainer, I can recommend one. Everyone says that Shazzana is the best trainer, but she is such a tyrant!"
"Stand thou in awe of my true power... Let there be PEACE!"
"I beg of thee, MageLord Filbercio, to spare this person's life. It was all my fault."
"'Twould be wrong for me to speak about people behind their backs."
"Then glory will be mine. And the ladies will truly fawn on me!"
"I like him. He even voted for me. But to tell thee the truth about Mack, he is a lunatic."
"Thou hast wine from our winery! I hope thou didst enjoy it... Hmm. It is the same vintage as the wine that disappeared."
"Yet Mad Iolo did laugh the entire time..."
"Thou seemest quite healthy!"
"I will train thee for 45 gold. Wilt thou pay?"
"What a pretty ring! A simple stone in a carved setting -- so unlike anything the Mages would have!"
"I cannot make any accusations, but we are incapable of leaving our post. Something dire must have happened to Number 7."
"Dost thou want to hear the story? It is called 'Hubert's Hair-Raising Adventure'."
"Yes, well... are not we all. Ahem. I suppose that I should not bore thee with my sophomoric philosophy."
"I can give thee 4 filari for for every 3 guilders thou hast."
"Some other time, then!"
"Very well."
"'Ophidians' is the word that Karnax uses for the people that once dwelled in the serpent ruins throughout the land."
"Yet the course of this trial could affect state security, chancellor. This man is accused of aiding a Daemon to overthrow our city!"
"Ummm.... I cannot seem to find my keys. Thou mightest return later."
"I can give thee 3 guilders for every 2 gold coins thou hast."
"The only place that such a rock could have come from, that I know of, is somewhere beyond Moonshade."
"No doubt thou hast heard tales of my romantic conquests! This is the answer I have found to the pressures of being MageLord."
"Thou hast caught me! Very well... the key is thine."
"I cannot allow thee to throw away thy life! Thou must live to ensure Britannia's safety!"
"Return tomorrow and thou canst have another free meal."
"Thou art not permitted here. It is dangerous here. The forces beyond these doors are not of mortal understanding."

"To be ashamed. To want nothing more than return of my possession from human."
"The Bears have saved this city again and again. They never forget that we live under siege, that the Goblins could always attack."
"To be a better warrior or mage?"
"The people of Fawn are content to let the world end... As long as it doth not mar their Beautiful view of the dying embers!"
"I must get some sleep! Thou shouldst return tomorrow..."
"Oh, I can tell thee all thou dost need to know about us!"
"Gurnordir was our greatest foe! Do his ashes stand for hatred, and thus the animals are produced to try to slay us?"
"To welcome thee to Britain, Avatar!"
"Pardon me for not recognizing thee, Sir Knight. I be an old man, and mine eyesight is not what it once was."
"It seems thou dost not have the funds to pay me... Hast thou considered drinking from the public well?"
"Kylista is lustful and greedy, but she is also cunning. She is very dangerous to us."
Day 9 -- Did some work for Batlin. He thinks too much of hisself. I wish he'd fall off a cliff.
"To tell you that this city is old. To have a long history before the gargoyles found it."
"And now that they have created the automatons, they may succeed."
"I am Pamela!"
"Yes... yes. Those are Filari."
"And," he adds, "there is a thief here."
"There was a stranger in Monitor, one who claimed to be from another land. He was very large, a scholar rather than a warrior."
"That is what Alyssand said in her testimony -- that thy friend did return her engagement ring to her."
"Yes, a good price that is!"
"A better time to train thee would be when I am in my study."
"To give you greetings, human."
"Hmmm, a key. Perhaps if thou dost ask Christopher's son about it, he may know what it is for."
"Thou hast not the room for the jug."
"'Tis the name of a particular hero of mine."
"Thou dost mean the strange glowing money that the mages use?"
"To want how many?"
"She vas Frederico's vife, but thou dost know that already, no? She vas a good voman."
"Robin be a high stakes gamblin' gent who makes his living inna casino at Buccaneer's Den."
"If the Oracle is so powerful, why did it not save us from the storms? Why did it let so many good men die?"
"Of the three of Leon's companions, I know the least about Kalen, and I have no desire to learn more."
"In times like these, I must charge high prices or close..."
"I can say nothing bad about Goodman Rocco and his inn! He is a gentleman."
"Excellent, Avatar!"
"I prefer smaller crowds, Avatar. Perhaps later."
Day 121 -- Something horrible happened to Hamlin.
"The Black Mage, Mortegro, hath been selected to take Rotoluncia's seat on the Council."
Dustin takes the stage as Paul moves away. Meryl lies on the ground in front of him and assumes a death-like pose.
"Thy vigilance will be our salvation, Priestess. Many thanks for responding to mine unusual summons."
"Little, fat man... Small beard and mustache... Angry scowl. I'm sure thou wilt remember him if thou hast met him."
"It not long ago when Neyobi was well. Then one morning she not wake. That is all I know."
You see a humble-looking older woman. She gives you a friendly smile.
"That is right! I have been in Monitor longer than anyone else here! I came to the town many, many years ago!"
"To be true! To apologize most sincerely for doubting you..."
"We are very poor. My baby and I are presently living in the Fellowship shelter because we have nowhere else to go."
"How much wouldst thou like to bet that Sprellic defeats all three of his challengers?"
"All right. Some other time."
"If thou wilt only let me explain the concepts, I am certain that thou wilt join our Cause."
"Many people believe that the Mages of Old Sosaria created the Oracle. I do not believe such."
"Gladstone is a sculptor and a glassblower. He also is in charge of most of the business decisions for the Guild."
"To be a miner for the Britannian Mining Company."
"I knew it vould happen. I varned Frederico. He vouldn't listen."
"Products of evil, I tell ya! We be folks as live off the bounty of the sea. But these storms do not like nothin' on the water!"
"A person like thyself, brave and adventurous, could be useful in times like these..."
"Perhaps I could find another song for thee..."
All is prepared for my greatest bacchanal ever.
"She is a tailor. Lovely woman, that Carlyn. She minds the bar when I go to the Fellowship meetings at night."
"I understand thou hast spoken with this villain."
You see a frowning gargoyle.
"Well, the alchemist is the one who started the fire!"
"Then thou must go elsewhere."
"Thou wilt never be warrior with such weak resolve!"
"Thou dost? An Urn of the Dead? How didst thou chance upon it? Perhaps thou hast slain the thieves who insulted mine ancestor's soul!"
"Olon might be able to tell ya more."
"You are thanked."
"Dost thou not actually mean dead from the neck down?"
"You always did have bad taste!"
"Hmmm. Hast thou reconsidered mine offer to investigate the murder?"
"I summon you, ghosts! Come join us here and speak with us. Share with us thy visions of this world and the next."
"I cannot tell thee what the coin is unless I see it, but if it isn't green and glowing, 'tis worthless."
"Why, 'tis the money used in the sea-city of Fawn. See the gems in the center!"
"To be agreed."
"I sell mutton, beef, and ham. Which wouldst thou like?"
"I regret that thou dost not seem to have enough gold to train here. Mayhaps at another time, when thy fortunes are more prosperous..."
"Hello! Lord British sent word that thou might come to visit us. Welcome to Cove, Avatar!"
"What a pleasure to meet one who is brave as well as handsome."
"She was only twelve when she was taken, so she never had the chance to pass the Test of Knighthood... Selene doth have no tattoos."
"So be it. Perhaps thou wilt enjoy a riddle later."
"Oh, of course! I did not mean to bore thee..."
"So, thou hast found out our little scheme, hast thou?"
"If only these terrible storms would end!"
"I answer to Karenna, and to nothing else."
"They friendly if we no hurt them."
"The children must be outside playing with Sherry now."
"Some other time, perhaps."
"Glance into my telescope, and its magical view shall penetrate the universe for thee!"
"I do not know where temple. Gwani place of death to west of Ice Dragon's lair. Temple is there somewhere."
"I regret to report that mine attempts to locate any significant quantity of the reagent Blood Moss have met with failure."
"I can offer thee mead, wine and ale."
"It will be done!"
"Thou dost not have enough gold for that!"
"I have no further questions. I thank thee."
"It hath driven her insane."
"I am missing nothing... 'tis not mine. Thou wilt have to ask others about it."
"Another time, then."
"Hast thou come seeking the wisdom of The Fellowship so that thee and thy Monitorian comrades can reclaim the tower?"
"Take it as a token of my love."
"What is the password?"
"Will you two be quiet!" ~"You are loud enough to wake the dead..." ~"And I am beginning to lose patience with both of you!"
"Thou cannot possibly carry that much!"
"Art thou friend or foe?"
"Tell me, Delin, hast thou ever met the accused?"
"Dost thou desire another purchase?"
"And if one of thy companions is killed, thou canst summon one of us to resurrect him or her, by use of the Hourglass."
"Why, Hello, Sir Dupre. Things fare well I trust?"
"Perhaps at a later time."
"Well... uh... these are made right here, by young Alyssand."
"Surely, brave Wilfred shall track down the sage and kill him, and I shall enjoy sweet revenge!"
"I do not understand what is wrong. My magic does not work so well anymore."
"Thou dost not have enough gold, toad."
"Hast thou reconsidered thy task? Wilt thou deliver the package to Elynor in Minoc?"
"Very good. I am pleased to call thee friend."
"A good showing! Thou hast gotten lucky and bested me! Perhaps it is time for the master to learn from his student!!!"
"This glowing rock must have come from some strange, unnatural place. I have never seen such a rock in any sort of place near here."
"Thou dost look like someone to carry Luther's water buckets! Har!"
"Do not toy with me, Hero! Though our purposes may be the same, our philosophies are not -- I know thee to be no friend of Chaos!"
"We are fortunate that we are able to live by The Fellowship's good graces, but I do not know how long we will be allowed to stay."
"To tell you Forbrak knows much about Terfin and its residents, and," he says, "about its conflicts."
"Thou wilt like our selection, I'm certain."
"Her heart did break and fade away Into the icy northern wind."
To win the game, a player must "push" the treasure to the back row of squares on his side of the board.
"Spektor, Caladin, Brendann and myself meet at noon every day to make all the decisions involved in ruling the town."
"But I am more interested in discussing Zelda."
"My name is Komor."
"Wouldst thou care for more?"
"I am carrying many items, some of which may be of use to thee. Wouldst thou care to have these back?"
"Thou shouldst ask Master Ducio. Or, better yet, Topo -- if thou dost wish an answer."
"There is no need to be vulgar. The Daemon King hath been dead for many centuries. No one doth serve him now."
"Such is the story of my life... Then I shall remain here, within this fetid swamp -- where I belong!"
"Is this not a nice day?"
"Yet I suspect Torrissio. He is a true swine, and it would take a devious person to plan such a crime."
"Why, thou shouldst know all about our little family by now!"
"That's all thou ever dost, Olon -- talk."
"Seek... Meek..."
"Leave me with that dirty bottle! It doth look to have been lying in the woods for weeks..."
You see a strikingly handsome man with eyes that pierce your soul.
"Very well..."
"'Tis just as well -- there are no great lovers in this place!"
"Only fruits, vegetables, and milk-stuffs are eaten by Emps. Bread is also eaten."
"I am Lord British's personal mage!"
"Citizens of a reclusive nature feel at peace there. Within the forest lie its buildings, many so grown-over as to seem a part of the wood."
"It is written that 'If the Hero from Another World doth fail, the world shall shudder unto death.'"
"Of course thou art new here! I know all other Mages in Moonshade... And I have never seen thee before."
"Interested in seeing the sights, eh? Well, I can tell thee about the islands, or the mountains."
"To mean `anti-dry-master.'"
"As loathsome as Luther is, perhaps he doth have a point. Krayg doth indeed take long walks in the woods, most strangely..."
"It doth seem difficult to believe that they could be talking about the Lord British we know."
"Avatar, how couldst thou?! Thou canst forget all about this idea!"
"Art thou ready to obtain thy tattoo?"
"Ducio is my Master. He produces the finest goods in all the city! His pottery is famed throughout the other islands as well..."
"She was a courageous Knight! I miss her very much..."
"Someone should question that weakling, and see if his guilt can be proven."
"If the War of Imbalance doth finally end, if Chaos is victorious or Order doth take the win, then we shall be freed to enter the Void."
"To be without a spellbook, human."
"Very well, I have been found out. There is no point in denying my guilt any longer. It was I who stole the money from the treasury."
"I shall not tell thee... At last, I, Sethys, have something important, something of value." *"I have a secret!"
"This is the Blue Boar Inn, and I am the barmaid. My name is Petra."
"Thou not hurt!"
"Indeed. Note the simple scrollwork, the plain glazing, the orange hue of the clay..."
"I have no friends. The Knights tolerate me and value my services, but they do not share mine interests."
"The true criminals are Priestess Kylista and Great Captain Voldin, who have conspired to convict this innocent man!"
"'Tis just as well... I do not know what changes were made after I left. It probably would not help."
"I have found many odd artifacts. Many of the things thou hast seen in The Music Hall and the Lycaeum have been brought to them by me."
"Thou hast escaped the foul mages' prison swiftly, indeed. Most wonderful!"
"I sell fish and chips from my wagon."
"Thou impudent snot!"
"Bats? What bats?"
"Taking care of my students is a tiring but fulfilling duty. Young Freli shows much promise, and Andrio is almost ready to graduate."
"Thou hast returned for thy belongings. Dost thou want them now?"
"Now thou must prepare for thy banquet, at which thou wilt become a Knight of Monitor."
"I am an orphan! My father has been most cruelly murdered, mutilated in the stables of Trinsic."
"Perhaps Columna would show thee her Serpent Tooth. I know that she possesses it."
"Thou art a lucky woman to possess such a fine pair of stockings!"
"I can give thee 2 gold coins for every 1 monetari thou hast."
You see an aging pirate who might have looked extremely dangerous at one time.
"However, I see nothing wrong with The Fellowship. If anything, it seems that Leon speaks more of the truth than thine own Priestess."
"I shall see thee at the Banquet Hall, Avatar. It is in the south part of town."
"And what of Rotoluncia? She dislikes thee -- everyone knows it."
"I do not have to answer that question. This is a matter of state security."
"Very good. At last we are getting somewhere!"
"As thou dost wish."
"A likely story! Listen here, swine -- thou art not the first to try to steal my favorite mistress..."
"Yes, they do!" Her face turns sad. "But I only sell."
"But of course! It is the Helm of Monitor, which thou didst recover from the Goblins!"
You see a shrewd-looking man who smiles as if he has just seen his next customer.
"I do not believe that we've met. It is so nice to make the acquaintance of a new, young Mage."
"I wish thee luck in all thine endeavors!"
"Silverleaf trees are where Emp's homes can be found."
"Of course, I know that level of expertise will take some time. But I have the discipline! Just ask Freli, he will tell thee I do."
"Beware them! They follow Draygan's orders unquestioningly! They would even kill at his word!"
"As thou dost not have the guilders to pay me, I am afraid thou shalt go hungry, felon."
"Forgive me. I shall go seeking my wife and leave thee to thy dream."
"Wilt thou agree to this price?"
"I am the artist who creates tattoos."
"The smithy is currently closed for outside business. Thou shalt have to return some other time."
"'Tis a puzzlement! Camille promised to make a delivery of wheat to me sometime today and it is late. I wonder where it could be."
"To make what purchase?"
"Apparently one of the mages hath taken a liking to them. They are the only ones who could afford such luxuries now."
"How may I be of use to thee?"
"And... After Batlin and his henchmen left Monitor, it was discovered that a valuable Serpent relic was stolen from Andral, the sculptor."
"All of the mages have gone daft or mad! What other proper response is there in a world that is so terrifically funny?!"
"Thou dost already have that spell!"
"How much wouldst thou pay for it?"
"Either the mage tries a spell that is too advanced for him, or he simply loses concentration. I do not know."
"As thou wishest. But bear in mind that the visions may be of aid to thee."
"Without mine aid thou canst not hope to escape, and I am no fighter! Without thee I am a dead man!"
He hands you his personal staff. It appears to be magical.
"It hath been a pleasure!" *"I will accept thine offer."
"My death only delays the inevitable, Avatar. Batlin will soon have more power than thou canst dream of, and my reward will be sure..."
"Wouldst thou try to retrieve mine Orb?"
"Thou mayest take thy bell. Use it in good health!"
"Olon, even I don't want ta hear that one... ever again!"
"Very well. Thou shalt remain in prison until we see fit to release thee."
"Well, to be precise, I should say that she suspects a recent visitor -- a Mage named Batlin."
"I assure thee, thou art in no danger! I would do this myself, but at mine age, climbing stairs is very difficult..."
"Covered in fur, like an animal. Hear they're worse than Goblins... even eat their own kind!"
"'Tis hard to think that Angus disappeared exactly like his grandfather did..."
"Since thou art so encumbered, I shall set this upon the ground."
"But I am more interested in discussing Brion."
He who passes the Trials will enter the Antechamber of the Grand Shrine.
"Please return when thou dost have the appropriate amount."
"What wouldst thou like to buy?"
"Thou dost not have the monetari to pay me."
"What can I do for thee, Miss Fool?"
"Our highest priority should be to raid that hidden Goblin camp, and destroy that evil race!"
"Name? Oh, my, what a formality! First thou hast saved my life and then thou dost ask my name! Thou art a curiosity!"
"Thou cannot carry that much!"
"Can't say without seeing it, but it might be the ring that one of our young ladies did lose."
"To want reagents or jewelry and potions?"
"She keeps saying that. I am not sure what it means. Something to do with a competition."
"Quite a nuisance, actually."
"It sounds like Priestess Kylista's ceremonial breastplate."
You see a simple peasant woman. Her face is etched with sorrow.
"Yes, master..."
"Thou shouldst have words with her, I think."
"Dost thou accept the price?"
"Andrew owns the dairy and lives across from Camille's farm and the slaughterhouse. He might have seen something."
"Thou art a rogue! I would not believe mine ears if I were told I had sold goods at this price!"
"Mine heart tells me that they were wrong. Shmed was a coward, a fool, and a reprobate -- but not a traitor."
"I believe that I can be of help..."
"I believe he went northeast from here, towards the little hamlet of Sleeping Bull."
"Perhaps thou shouldst have these stone chips examined by the healer, Lady Leigh."
"To be willing to share... To be angry that the Men in Armour do not want to share. To want only to kill us."
"In my mind's eye, I see a large object in a dungeon north of here. Thou dost know of what I speak, dost thou not?"
"To be named Betra. To be new to Terfin?"
"It looks most comely on thee. Thou must be the adventurous sort..."
You see a man covered in the sweat of a hard day's work.
"To hold meetings at 9 p.m., in unity with other branches, human. To be welcome at our meetings."
"And if thou shouldst ever speak to a disfigured cripple named Morghrim --"
"They are the counselors of Lady Yelinda, by title. They control the fishing fleets... or did before the storms began."
"I shall meet thee as before. Now, go..."
"Ah, but perhaps thou shouldst!"
"I thank thee, kind sir. I know not how to repay thee."
"After all, no mortal can resist the Dance of Passion."
"Goblins hunt us without mercy. Hatred for us almost greater than hatred for humans."
"I thank thee for all that thou hast done. The forest and its animals are free from the evil that Draygan had instilled in them."
"I am Murray."
"Do not tell that I told thee this, but do not take such a matter to Julia -- "
"There is much I must tell thee before the sand runs down in the Hourglass of Fate."
"What sort of items art thou inquiring about?"
"I have been around for many, many years. And," he smiles, "I have seen many, many things in that time."
"There are so many beautiful things to see in Britannia. Both animals and plants alike offer excitement to the observer."
"Ah, so thou art a true accolyte of Order. I will permit thee to enter the Grand Shrine."
"The Mandrake Roots only appear when the tides are right -- otherwise, they lay beneath the mud and cannot be seen."
"Thou wouldst style thyself a bard now? Perhaps I should bow."
"Lydia must have been part of Shmed's secret conspiracy. But that no longer matters -- both of the Goblin spies are dead!"
"Fawn is a pretty city, built on the water. 'Tis on the west side of the mainland."
"We saw the ship that had just put out be hit by the lightning and it just... disappeared! Never found a trace of it or her crew."
"Thou canst be more reasonable than that..."
"To be a laborer for the town."
"Dost thou agree to my rate?"
"First, let me see thy stance."
"I will tell thee for 5 gold. Interested?"
"A female mage would wear stockings such as the ones thou didst discover amongst thy possessions."
"Then I will keep thine inventory for thee. Find me if thou changest thy mind."
"How could I have been so naive? I was never part of their plans, but only a tool."
"None can take the Test of Knighthood without the permission of the Lord of Monitor. Dost thou seek my permission?"
"Why, I am Lord British's personal cook! I prepare meals for the entire castle."
"I know nothing other than the fact that they are said to exist, and that they are supposedly fraught with peril."
"I'm sorry... Thou hast heard all of my songs."
"Perhaps it is best this way... I know not how to look upon his face and not wonder if there is some evil lurking there."
"As thou canst see, Thoxa and I are both skilled enough that we both yet live."
"Hmmm. I might could give thee a clue."
"My name is Morfin."
"To tell you that our slumber is filled with a single Dream, a vision of a Hero from another world..."
"To be agreed!"
It is this curiosity which has brought me to this island from which Exodus, the spawn of Mondain and Minax, sought to rule the world.
"Thou dost not have enough gold for that!"
"'Tis a good price, and a great value."
"Is he in good health?"
"Begone from my sight, miscreant!"
"I must be going. The others are waiting..."
"I can give thee 400 gold coins for every gold bar thou hast."
"What can I do for thee? I am Templar."
"I trust his ability as I trust no other. I cannot tell thee how proud I was when he chose me to be his second in command!"
"The Great Captains are the counsellors to Lady Yelinda, ruler of Fawn. There are three of them: Garth, Joth and Voldin."
"We have many nice clothes to choose from."
"The finest wine press in all the land! For it operates by no human hand!"
"I am adrift! I am torn to my very soul and I know not what to do. Thou must help me."
"Here ye are!"
"'Tis a blessing that the honored Pikemen ripped the Fawn tower from them Goblins."
"Camille is a good woman. She lives at the farm bordering the dairy."
"Thou dost not have enough gold for that!"
"How could she betray the patrol? She was a tattoo artist, not a warrior..."
"A Moonshadian mage created a potion that enabled us to make our appearance Man-like. But it is addictive! I cannot live without it..."
"Thou must put something down if thou art to carry the flag!"
"Do not digress! Now, I am told that thou hast been seen speaking with the accused traitor..."
"How many dozen dost thou want?"
"There is much that we could do to make them feel less lonely, Avatar, if thou dost know what I mean..."
"I am documenting this information in my notebook."
"Then thou shouldst go to see Batlin in Britain."
"He was an evil man, Avatar. Captain Voldin forced me to do his bidding, beating me when I refused!"
"I hesitate to leave thee. But if thou dost insist..."
"Most of the young people of the town belong to the Cause -- but they are not willing to say so publicly, for fear of exile."
"What dost thou take me for, a bear?! I am not that witless!"
"In fact, I believe that we have the most concise collection of Ophidian books and scrolls that still exists."
"Thou hast found me out! Yes, it was I who planted the venom on Tobias. He did deserve it! I beg thee, please do not tell my parents!"
"If thou art not going to buy anything, then get thy face out of my sight!"
"No other Mage doth have a spell named after them... Of course she is famous! Why everyone agrees how remarkably useful it is!"
"Without Pomdirgun leading them, the goblins would never have had the nerve to take the Pikeman tower."
"How many wouldst thou like?"
"We are the guardians of Moonshade. The City of Mages hath always been guarded by Rangers."
"Not so fast, deary! Ye don't think that ye kin just dance outta here with that little seed so easy, now do ye?"
"Thou hast not the room for this meat."
"Do not die, my sweet King..."
"There have also been many Goblins in the area, so beware!"
"Thou dost know it. Attendees of the Retreat must stay out of this cave."
"Thou dost not carry a pikeman! I can only pay thee for bringing me the bodies of fallen knights. Only they deserve such respect..."
"Are you sure? Think again!"
"But I say that 'tis no duty for a woman. I know thou wouldst agree with me, mate."
"Then thou must see Batlin of Britain. He is the founder of The Fellowship."
"After all, Columna is more of a woman than thou canst ever hope to be."
"Aaargh! I cannot keep pace with thee! My chest feels as though it shall soon explode!"
Rudyom looks around and scratches his head.
"It is good to see a Knight who is not boastful. Luther, thou couldst learn from this one."
"Which coin dost thou care to exchange for gold?"
"As thou dost wish."
The female Emp appears nervous.
"And its greatest gossip, as well!"
"Well, his brother, Brion, is quite attractive, I think."
"Of course. Um, what was it we were discussing...?"
"But Master, thou dost know something of teleportation! What about the...?"
She blows you a kiss.
When it was destroyed, his psyche could no longer retain its hold on the Dark Core.
"Then he must remain in his cell."
"Karnax hath made an exhaustive study of the history of the Serpent people. He can tell thee most anything about them."
"She's what passes for a healer in these forsaken parts ever since the last healer was et by them goblins."
"If that is thy wish, Avatar, but they are quite good!"
"My group is called... well, it is called 'The Avatars'. I hope that does not offend thee."
"Please keep this to thyself. Only a few select individuals are aware of this crime. Frankly, we do not want a panic."
"I'm not sure of what thou speakest, but perhaps Pothos the Apothecary could identify it for thee."
"Gladly I will for a fellow Knight. Have a pleasant day and may goblin blood stain thy sword soon."
"Doth that include the head?"
"Better we talk in the morning, mate. As for right now, I'm goin' back to sleep..."
"Couldst thou please decide!?"
"How many types of weapons are discussed in Erstam's book?"
"He scares me to death."
"There are those that consider her a handsome woman, when her mouth is closed... If thou knowest what I mean."
"Brunt is no seaman, 'tis true."
"Thou couldst use a warrior like myself, to guard thee against thine enemies. With me on hand, nothing could harm thee!"
"Oh, that reminds me it is nearly time for my meal break! The trout is supposed to be delicious today at the Farmer's Market."
"While it is true that I am a Mage, I am not an Adept. And Filbercio invites only Adepts to his banquets, as a rule."
"Thou shouldst consider attending one of our meetings in the evening."
Spark turns beet red.
"Perhaps another time then..."
"Dost thou desire a stiff drink, a warm meal, or a room where thou canst rest?"
"What wouldst thou like to buy?"
"Bring it by, and I shall give thee thine answer."
"Hello. Art thou sure thou dost not really want to speak with Roberto?"
"My fee will leave thee with nothing!"
"How many suits of chain armour wouldst thou care to sell?"
"It is an ancient and powerful talisman, endowed with the Principle of Courage. Thus, it can only be worn by the bravest of warriors."
"Once the pinecone releases its seeds, it becomes a dried husk. Being light, it is transported by wind and wave."
"To wonder if you are the Hero."
"But I can tell thee about the other towns, if thou wouldst like."
"My practice grew swiftly. I am a modest man, but I do not mind saying that I was a popular healer."
"Take this Serpent's Tooth... Thou must seek the Dead on the Isle of Crypts."
"Thou dost not have enough room to carry the potion!"
"To say sadly that Men come to do us harm. To not understand why they call us Daemons..."
"I could not help noticing your medallion. It does look somewhat sinister. I cannot recall ever having seen one like it before."
"Father was the best blacksmith in Britannia. People were always coming from everywhere to get him to make this and that."
"But times changed. A tyrant named British overthrew the kingdoms and declared himself king."
"Training costs 50 Monetari. All right?"
"Is not that the finest rack thou hast ever seen? Exquisite workmanship, beautiful detail."
"I could not accept money from a friend!"
"All I know is that Celennia and Frigidazzi had some sort of noisy falling out, over the Mage that came here, I did hear."
"Somehow, we must regain the Helm!"
"No?" He seems genuinely surprised. "Then perhaps thou wilt consider taking up my quest in thine own manner."
"Thou cannot travel with that much!"
"Filbercio is the MageLord! And thou wouldst do well not to forget that while thou art in Moonshade."
"Delin, go to thy seat please."
Today, icy blew the winds from beyond the Frozen Lands.
"Aye, sure as ships sail. That be Alyssand's ring all right. Keth showed it to me enough times, I should know."
The ape-like female appears nervous.
"My dreams have become reality. Thou art the Avatar, art thou not? I recognized thee immediately!"
"I am sorry I cannot be of more help."
"The goblins are most likely preparing for an assault on our city."
"Wonderful! This will be far less trouble for thee..."
"Simple people need a simple philosophy."
"Return if thou dost reconsider... I doubt that thou canst finish thine own quest without mine aid."
"Frigidazzi is the Adept that specializes in cold spells. I have heard her referred to as the 'ice maiden'!"
"It was horrible! I was a wolf! I know I was! I saw myself in a reflection on a puddle of water!"
"About whom doth thou wish to know? Auston? The gargoyles? Liana? Cador? Perhaps Yongi?"
"The Fellowship is designed to enrich the lives of everyone who resides in this fair land."
"Brendann's womanizing speaks well enough for the character of the rank and file of his troops."
"There is nothing that thou canst do here, Avatar! We will be crushed and dragged beneath the waves if we stay!"
You see a sulking lad, who doesn't seem to want to look you in the eye.
"The language is vague and hard to understand."
"Oh. Never mind, then."
"Owings and myself are now involved in a very important special project, but it is a secret. Can we trust thee?"
"Thou hast not heard? Why, two hundred years ago she put herself to sleep."
I can almost taste the salt breeze from the sea.
"Excellent choice!"
"I knew one of them Mages could help me!" *"We be goin' home soon..." ~"After Edrin finds a ship to return on."

"We cannot allow any lapse in Discipline. I suspect that he has lost sight of the absolute Ethicality."
"I think I know the stockings thou art speaking of, but I am not certain..."
"I'll wager that chest is locked. Thou shouldst try thy lockpicks on it."
"To be fine."
"I am now without a cause to champion. I see that thou art without thy companions. If thou wishest, I will join thee."
"It sounds as though thou art describing a pinecone. They come from trees far to the north of here."
"I am dreadfully sorry but the Provisioner's Shop is currently closed. Do return at noon when it shall be open once again."
A finely crafted silver ring, probably the lost engagement ring of a lass named Alyssand.
"As the voice of compromise and experience, I have always been selected MageLord by the Adepts."
"He is human called Hazard. He lives in cave north on Ice Plains. I fear he not stop hunt us until he hunt us to extinction."
"'Tis a pity that thou art marooned here."
"For if thou dost go a-hunting them, Thou shalt never return home again."
"I shall make a cloak from its skin for thee."
"She doth seem happier of late, since the Lady did allow the Fellowship scum to return to the city."
"Please do not approach me again until the Oracle hath ruled!"
"To train during training hours. To ask you to come back to me at that time, please."
"And we are carrying an animal's skull, given to us by the strange storm -- it must have changed places with my bow!"
"Art thou truly the Avatar?"
"Thou shouldst go to Moonshade."
"And to think thou art a fellow member. There is no unity in thy speech!"
"Wonderful!"
"He is quite looney. If thou dost ask me, I believe all the mages in the land are afflicted. Take a look and find out for thyself."
"To be named Wis-Sur, which means `wise sun.'"
"They are always so full and ready for use. They are so good about keeping them filled and clean!"
"I run The Modest Damsel, here in New Magincia."
"I accept thine offer!"
"We have not had many strangers in our town lately. Let me introduce myself. I am Shazzana, a Knight of the Leopards."
"Heresy! Leave this Temple and never return to our fair city, upon pain of death!"
"But now I am so confused... 'Twas Kylista who told us that The Fellowship was false, but now she doth stand accused of heresy..."

"Luckily, Columna hath been very understanding of the time I devote to my work."
"To sell to you during the hours of 9 in the morning and 6 in the evening. To be sorry, but to sell nothing before or after those hours."
An enameled breastplate, suitable for ceremonial occasions.
"Now, I do not agree with all this talk of a spy in our midst. Do not let these rumors divide our city, Caladin."
You see a lean, young fighter with a rather dashing flair.
"So be it. Perhaps thou wilt enjoy a riddle later."
"It would do me better to tell everyone that thou hadst stolen this from me!"
"I do not know any man by that description."
"To understand."
"Word has spread quickly of thine arrival, Avatar! Welcome!"
"If thou wilt undertake the task I ask, I shall reward thee with the Serpent necklace."
"To know that thou art a Mage, yet to see that thou art so manly -- this is most uncommon in Moonshade!"
"Speaking with the spirits of the dead doth fatigue me. We must wait another day before I can muster the energies required."
"Very well... perhaps another time."
"What wouldst thou like to buy?"
"How may I help thee now? Dost thou have need of healing, or dost thou wish to buy my vegetables?"
"In the climax of the Test of Knighthood, one doth mix one's own blood with the Ashes of Gurnordir."
"That is a remnant from one of mine experiments, something for Vasel to clean after. What art thou doing carrying that thing around?"
"But Ice Dragons very rare creatures. Gwani honor all life -- try everything before we hunt them."
"He is the Keeper of Knight's Test. Shmed is a Wolf, and if thou dost ask me, he hath gone soft. Hardly ever see him on the List Field."
"It was a coup to steal such an artifact from old Erstam, but now the trophies lie abandoned in the mansions..."
"Dost thou want me to wait here or dost thou want me to go home to Yew?"
"Thou cannot possibly carry that much!"
"He bought the slaughterhouse a few years ago, soon after he joined The Fellowship. I knew the previous owner."
"Sounds like a pinecone to me!"
"Dried fish very good food. It keeps thou from hunger longer than other food."
"Alyssand's the daughter of Delin, the shopkeeper. Thou mightest think she hath had enough sadness in her short life."
"He is an easy man to find, for Sir Horffe hardly ever leaves his side. Watch for the tall, muscular gargoyle."
I alone, a servant of Balance, am left. I soon will die. All is Death, and the land forsaken.
"Yes, in the forest near our farm there are a terrible number of Goblins. They often come to raid us on the way to the city."
"Surely, thou wouldst not take advantage of a girl for a few hasty words?"
"And the storms are growing more frequent and fierce with each passing day."
"I was making a humorous remark, musician."
Standing before you is a statuesque fighting woman with eyes that radiate a familiarity with danger.
He turns back to you and grins.
"I wish thee good fortune, and once again I thank thee for restoring me."
"We did pass through an illusionary wall to enter. Might there be another leading from this place to somewhere else?"
"I handle the books and the paperwork, and I'm the local money exchanger. I also collect and administer the taxes."
"Tsandar's devotion to Order is strong, to be sure. But how could he expect to command now that Isstanar is here?"
"I hope to see thee again soon, honey!"
"I tell thee, the Daemon exists, and his schemes to destroy Fawn can only be averted by the justice of the Oracle!"
"Snakes would be pleasant compared to what thou canst find here..."
"Thou dost not have a spellbook."
"Thou dost not have anything that I want to buy!"
"Thou dost not have enough money."
"Rhys thought that if he could figure out if one of the mystics was a truth-teller, he could learn the whereabouts of the hidden pass."
"They come from big trees, but not like those hereabouts. Thou couldst ask Olon about it, he hath travelled quite a bit."
"Tvellum is my name."
"Christopher was a valued member of The Fellowship for some time. Unfortunately, we got into a petty argument last week."
"I am very excited, for shortly a very rare event will occur!"
"He hath destroyed the lives of many." ~"He doth deserve to be tortured for all the ill that he hath done."
"I believe it was thee she was referring to, Avatar."
"Thou art hard to catch, Avatar. But now thou must die!"
"Then why are we talking about the Hound of Doskar?! Bah! I have heard more coherent conversations from trees!"
"I have moved my store here as a service to Lord British, who uses me exclusively to outfit all of his various expeditions. It is true!"
"So I went to the Pikemen..."
"Give to me the body."
"What dost thou care to buy, felon?"
"'Tis awful, is it not? Of course, I was home with Klog all night."
"Perhaps another time, then."
"Thou mayest take thy sextant! And may thou always have smooth sailing!"
"Will it hurt! Thou art not fit to be a Knight of Monitor."
"'Tis my master who calls me Vasel. Thou mayest address me by that name as well."
"But wait... I feel the primal forces drawing near... I hear the voices of the Void..."
"I am making a list of the strange items which the storm gave us."
"Another of Monitor's female Pikemen, I see. Odd that they encourage women to disfigure themselves." *"I am Great Captain Voldin."
"How many sets of twelve wouldst thou like?"
"The rite is to be performed in the most sacred precincts of the Shrine, before the Wall of Lights."
"The Goblins are dangerous. Watch out for them. As for me, I must return to my duties now."
"Perhaps this hath something to do with the multi-colored storms."
"After Argus left, Angus raised Wilfred very strictly. So Wilfred holds Argus in no great esteem."
"Sleek... Speak... Squeak..."
"I am Bradman."
"My soul is at peace. Joy is to know Gwenno, and to have her once more in thriving good health."
"Thou dost not have enough gold for that!"
"'Tis a pleasure to do business with thee, Sir Dupre! And welcome to my pub!"
"Wouldst thou care for another spell?"
"Thou art wrong! Number 1 can tell thee where I was when Number 7 disappeared!"
"To be honest, he did not strike me as an honest man. Never cared much for bards. Louts, every one of them!"
"That thieving scoundrel belongs in here more than I do! Don't trust him if ye've gotta choice."
"To be without the ability to carry that much!"
"Seek out the true Moon's Eye in the Temple of the Ancient Ones in the icy wastes to the north. It will show thee what thou must know..."
"I charge 200 gold coins to instruct students in the ways of war. Dost thou agree?"
"If thou wouldst like a room, just say so!"
"The Avatar will not accept thine offer, foul fiend!"
"Want to sing an opera, Avatar?"
"There will be a Grand Trial soon. At the end of the proceedings, I shall proclaim the verdict."
"Because I have to... to touch... all those things! I have to pick them up, with all their little squeaky noises... and squirming!"
"Of course, as an apothecary, I could buy it from thee... And find a buyer or two with clearance to possess it."
"I wouldst give thee back thy gold but thou cannot take it."
"'Twill do no good to speak with the Mages, for they ignore Mundanes like ourselves."
"That is it, goat! Meet me at the List Field! There I shall ram thy words down thy throat!"
"I thank thee for ferreting out the thief and returning my snake venom."
"I thought so!"
"Alcoves... Pain... Cannot succeed..."
"I do not know the whole of it, in truth."
"If thou hast no suspects, then thou surely art clueless! I mourn for thee and thy lost friend."
"Thou must find them, Hero! And then never let them leave thy side..."
"It is a shame, a heartsore shame,"
"Mine ancestors found the relic when they first founded this city, and it hath been kept in the family all this time."
"Be sure and take this to Thurston, the mill owner. He shall pay thee for thy trouble."
"Budo's offers thee excellent weaponry with superb craftsmanship. Thou wilt not find a better buy for thy money anywhere else!"
"Dost thou want me to wait here or should I go home?"
"Confine thyself to my questions only, please."
"I see," he eyes you suspiciously. "Thou art back for more, then? Thou'lt not trick me again, I warn thee."
"I do not know what it is! And if I do not know, then no one shall."
"Ye care, do ye? All right, then. I'll tell ye my name if ye tell me thine, deal?"
"Alas, I cannot save thy friend. I will provide a proper burial. Thou must go on and continue with thine own life."
"The silk is so soft! Didst thou know that the stockings are made from the cocoons of lunar moths?"
"My rates are the same as every other moneychanger..."
"Thou dost shame all womankind by thy cowardice."
"I was not so sure, but since that is what my father says, it must be true."
"His greatest desire is to be helpful, as well as ordered. In fact, it was he who divined the passage that foretold of thy coming."
"Which coin dost thou care to exchange for guilders?"
"I am Standarr the Armourer. What dost thou wish of me?"
"I follow the Guide, meself, an' it's enough that I be 'ere ta meet ye ta tell ol' Drusilla whose pot is cracked an' whose isn't."
"To be good. To want to sell nothing to you."
"Gwenno, canst thou hear me? Gwenno, my dear,"
"But it is all foolishness! Fawn Tower hath been conquered, and the Goblins will not stop there!"
"Surely thou dost wish to purchase some?"
"I like thee already! I am Garok Al-Mat."
"Use the key to obtain the waters of Logic. Thou hast well earned that honor."
"The training flag was set."
"I am the golem called Adjhar, at thy service."
"What wouldst thou like to buy?"
"If thou art seeking out this venom thief, thou wouldst do well to ask Andrew about it."
"Wait! I remember! He is my Knight's Bridge opponent! We play on my Knight's Bridge court just north of mine house."
As a courtesy to other travellers, please leave the rest house in the manner that thou didst find it...
An angry retort dies on Iolo's lips as the elderly mage lifts his hands in a gesture of peace.
"Dost thou wish to hear one?"
He turns to Trellek. "Please apologize to thy kindred for me. I never meant to destroy thine 'omes. Friends, ay?"~~ Trellek smiles and nods.
"If thou dost travel in a lighter fashion, thou wouldst have hands to take my gold!"
"One of the Temple guards is sympathetic to our Cause. He hath given me this key, which will lead thee into the hidden parts of the Temple."
"If the Mages can speak plain enough to explain what they need, I can make it."
"I am sure Father would be pleased with this price."
"Thou didst find evidence in the woods? Good thinking! Thou shouldst have been a Bear, not a Wolf..."
"Warriors, be still! There is no spy in Monitor, and I refuse to hear more of this!"
"I am a monk here at the Abbey. I am working on an alchemical mixture."
"Aha, but I cannot speak of this with thee! It is a private matter..."
"Dost thou agree?"
"She is the Priestess of Beauty -- the cult that controls Fawn."
"Slippers! What business is my footwear to thee! Dost thou think to have a laugh at mine expense?"
"And know that my little ones call ye friend as well, as do their larger cousins."
"I have mentioned this war to thee already. Shall I repeat what I said?"
"I saw that! A red bolt of energy, it was!"
"Then thou very smart!"
"If thou hast spoken to each of us and hast determined that one of us is guilty, accuse accordingly. But be not hasty in thy judgment."
"Indeed, 'twas as if a living serpent had been changed into stone -- a perfect replica!"
"Thou hast come to learn spells, but I can teach thee some true magic..."
"All Emps are food-gatherers. Mainly fruits are sought by us."
If a maid did not hold up the wick.
"I must go now, before those who oppose me find that I have been here."
"Hawk is the captain of the Arabella."
"The deed I can sell thee is for the ship 'The Scaly Eel.' It goes for 600 gold. Interested?"
"What reagents dost thou desire to buy?"
"Forgo the pretense, I am Hazard the Trapper as thou dost know well by now."
"Thou shouldst not waste my time so! I am a busy man!"
"To suspect you are wasting my time!"
"Any Mage could tell thee that this is a piece of lab equipment!"
"Thou dost need me, father. Thy business is much too complex for thee to run by thyself!"
"That could be it, right enough. Though thou shouldst ask Alyssand herself. Mine eyes are not what they were."
"It is not a difficult job. Sir Richter and Sir Horffe insure that things run smoothly as often as possible."
"One mystic wore a black sash while the other two had brown sashes."
"I suspect that Batlin hired him to act as a personal guard in this foreign land. He is not fit for much else."
"Since the Mages are all basically vain, that must mean that the spell is a secret... or at least not common knowledge."
"I do not know what thou art talking about."
"To agree!"
"That would be Mister Gordy, the overseer of the House of Games. Thou might find him in his office during business hours."
"'Twould appear thou dost not have enough money for that..."
"How much do ye want?"
"To have once had the Serpent Staff. To have been taken by the troll king."
"Um, sorry. I mean, welcome to Monitor! My name is Cantra."
"Petra is the automaton at the Blue Boar. Torrissio created her."
"Courage is the Soul of Life."
"Fool! Dost thou think those flimsy doors are my prison? That the meager traps and inconsequential guards hold me here? Nonsense!"
"Let it be said that Sir Dupre died bravely!"
"I oversee the local branch of the Britannian Mining Company in Vesper. We mine many different minerals."
"My friend, I am convinced thou hast been the victim of an evil scheme! Tomorrow, I shall speak with Shmed personally."
"But that does not matter for soon I will be dead."
"What dost thou say to this?"
"I understand perfectly. Why wouldst thou, who hast already solved my riddles, want to hear them again?"
"I know of no one that could help thee with this. I know nothing of beverages. Perhaps Lucilla knows something..."
"We thought of asking Joth to aid us, but he hath not been the same since the storms."
"If thou wouldst talk to me when I am at work, I would gladly sell thee something."
"The three Adepts are the most powerful wizards in the city. They compose the Council of Mages, which governs the city."
"Hast thou decided to become a Knight yet? It is so exciting! I am practicing to become one myself."
"I have had no contact with Freli since he was taken away. No mortal can win in a struggle against wizards..."
"Selene must have ensorcelled her! How else could one explain how Lydia would commit the dishonorable crime of poisoning a stranger?"
"Thy friend Gwenno doth not seem right, oh great one."
"How many dost thou want?"
"What else dost thou desire of me?"
"How many cities were established in the Serpent Isle?"
"If I am wrong this time, then thine enemy must not be Rotoluncia, but rather some other Mage."
"Bring the meat to Lucilla in the pub, and she shall prepare the feast."
"'Tis important that thou art comfortable whilst visiting The Baths."
"But of course! Thou must needs go to Fedabiblio for the answers..."
"Oh. Never mind, then."
"I can train anyone."
"We serve a good plate of slop, if I do say so myself! That Silverleaf is something. Thou shouldst try that."
"Thou dost not have the serpent scroll!"
"Oh, no... Why is it that everyone expects the Avatar to help with their love life?"
"Oh! One of thy friends hath met an untimely end. This should not be..."
"Only a coward fights from a distance, not that I be referring to thee or nothing."
"Thou dost not have the gold for that!"
You see a flamboyant-looking gentleman. He is very cheerful and outgoing, greeting you with a smile and a wave.
"Yes, that entire vile race is the scourge of all men of the Serpent Isle."
"Dost thou wish to exchange more coins?"
"Avatar, let us use the Amulet to return to where we were. We have enough to worry with on this quest without such presumptuous women!"
"I can give thee 30 guilders for every 1 gold nugget thou hast."
"I do not remember it clearly, for my sanity was lost when I found Delphynia's body."
"To have no need for my healing."
"Thou hast thine hands full, idiot!"
"Have a drink or two... Thou wilt soon forget her."
"Not long ago, one of those strange storms took the lighthouse that was up the coast, north and east of here."
"I thought so! Tell him that bloody thing still doesn't work! It gives me three shadows! Dadows badows whoopeee! Ha ha ha!"
"'Tis it, sure as the tide comes in! Keth flashed it around enough, I'd recognize it anywhere."
"Torrissio is the Adept that makes the automatons. No one knows how he does it..."
"We have restored life to thy flesh, as promised, Hero from Another World. Now thou must continue thy quest."
I am dreaming. I hear the bells and I wake...
You see a mountain man who appears to have been in the wilderness a long time. He gives you a long look, then he snorts and looks away.
"Ah, yes... I had nearly forgotten."
"I shall remember thy poor manners in the future! Mark my words!"
"Until thou dost bring proof, no one will believe us..."
This is a cute toddler holding a baby doll.
"Certainly. LB is always a repository of the most amazing facts, eh? Probably something to do with listening and not always talking."
"My name is Sasha."
"Wouldst thou allow me to accompany thee back to Moonshade? I am afraid that I do not know where I am."
"Er... I am sorry, daughter."
"To be here later if you need me."
"To go your way! To leave my people to their slumbers, and the fate which grasps them in the night."
"You don't know?" He frowns.~~ "You should learn before the voice become angry!"
"I still do that," he says, shrugging. "But not as good as when home."
"Art thou not honored? We meet again..."
"Now that thou hast mastered the Principle of Love, I no longer serve a function."
Figg takes an apple from a nearby basket. After polishing it slightly on his shirt, he hands it to you.
"In the City of Monitor, everyone is a Knight."
"The time for the duels must be drawing near. Good luck to Sprellic, and to thee as well!"
"What doth this mean? The verdict hath changed..."
"It's made from the root of a very rare tree. Quite superb, it is!"
"Yes, I poisoned thee, but I will not say who did instruct me to do so!"
"Thou hast entered my shop, so thou had best buy something."
Alagner listens as you tell him you would like to borrow the notebook.
"'Tis why I didn't worry 'til morn... When I found everything in disarray and Angus gone."
"In Fawn, women are valued for their beauty... At the cost of their independence and intelligence."
"A Knight who had scarce drawn his sword in many moons..."
"I am the proprietor of the inn."
The severed hand from one of the Mad Mage's experiments. It is not dead, yet not living -- it doth not decay.
"I am a man! I am a man! I cannot tell thee how miserable it is to be a bird."
"Thou wouldst have me say such things in front of a lady? Weren't thou the one what was tellin' me ta mind me manners?"
"Peasant fools and sheep. The only thing worth a second look in this whole town is Constance."
"When I went to press the one on the left, these comely folks begged me not to."
"Join thee now? When I was not good enough to continue with thee before? I think not!"
"Here they are."
Then came a great war, and the Four Lands were sundered from one another. Then, we were alone.
"Such cruel acts did he commit, that I cannot relate them lest my soul shrivel and die."
"Oh! If only he would have posed in my studio! I could have created such art..."
"I would give thee thy sextant, but thou art carrying too much to take it from me."
"Thou hast returned without my phoenix egg! Is this some kind of great meaningless joke to thee?"
"He offends with every breath that comes out of his ugly face!"
"Aye. But then again, doth legend not claim that Daemons have silver tongues? This Iolo doth certainly have charm..."
"Cador is the head of the Britannian Mining Company branch here in Vesper."
"Very good. Here is thy title."
"If thou art ready to see thy friend again, thou dost have but to ask and I will return them to thee."
"And thou hast enchanted the arrow? Then use it -- use it to numb the tyrant Draygan!"
"Dost thou desire another purchase?"
"Thou dost return? Perhaps to regale me with stories of thine exploits?"
"I will tell thee as I told him. Sleep passes thy time here, and may provide thee with new ideas for winning thy freedom."
"I used ta believe in that stuff. But what Beauty is there in the world for a sailor who cannot sail?"
"Mine husband Fred and I run the Farmer's Market."
"I would be happy to talk with thee about employment at my shoppe during normal business hours."
The warrior carries himself with confidence.
"Forgive me. I have no questions for thee."
"After that battle I caved-in some of the passageways near my cave and moved large boulders to block other entrances into my cave."
"I have already told described the liche to thee. Shall I tell thee about the liche again?"
"Battles. M'self, I be a stranger to New Magincia."
"I thought I already signed that bill!"
"I can give thee 1 gold coin for every 2 filari thou hast."
You see a beautiful young woman with a tropical air.
"What business is it of thee, stranger? Canst thou not see that I am recovering from wounds?"
"Very well." *"I accept thine offer!"
You see a man who gives you a friendly smile.
"What dost thou say to this?"
"I cannot imagine why it was there. Someone must be trying to implicate The Fellowship!"
"Better that such fabric be unwoven or burned!"
"Why, how dare thou speakest to the Avatar in that manner, Smith!"
"Yes, I do. Strange, is it not?"
"I must defer to the Lady..."
"I was a farmer; of course, that was before the seven year drought. Komor, Fenn and myself were reduced to paupers."
"Do not tell me that thou hast not heard that legend!"
"Friendly fellow -- I like him. His name is Elad."
"To be good to see you again, old friend. To be needing Draxinusom again so soon?"
"Now that thou hast worked a little for The Fellowship, and hast learned what we stand for, dost thou still wish to join?"
"Some other time, perhaps."
"Which of you wishes to train?"
"When I came to try to dissuade Thoxa from aiding thee directly it was not an attack against thee."
"But I am more interested in discussing Zelda."
"Oh, thou canst ask anyone in town about it. They all know."
"The transaction is done!"
"Thou dost have more than one! How many art thou willing to sell?"
"Emotion is the energy that drives the soul. There is both good and bad energy, combined chaotically."
"They would be Russell, the shipwright; Henry, the peddler; and Sam, the flower man."
"Dost thou have my phoenix egg?"
"The person to ask for that information would be Phearcy, the bartender. All I know are other bar patrons: Tolemac and Morz, two farmers."
"Perhaps from his association with the Beast! How sinister..."
"My lovely Gwenno!"
"Ah, good! 'Tis not mine at all. Thou must understand that every item of magical equipment must be custom-made for each Mage."
"She must have been someone's servant. Said she wanted ta go home for a visit. Said she might be here for me ta take her back."
"Oh, he is the old man who administers the Test. I do not like him much. He looks at me oddly sometimes..."
"To be called Inwisloklem."
"Thou hast bargained me to a bitter price, but then, I do not own this store!"
"I have no more. For some reason, no one is sending Silverleaf to us, so I cannot make a meal from it."
"To be sad... To know that we are fading rapidly. To hope that the Hero comes soon."
"Magic! It seems as if some dark magic is following me these days..."
"Not only were we bound in service to this wizard for a thousand years, but he also placed a dreadful curse upon us."
"I believe thou hast enough travellers for one group."
"I am certain I have something that will interest thee. Browse to thine heart's content."
"Father said I were too much like my great-grandfather, Silverpate. He never thought I'd amount to much, even after I'd made Captain."
"My name is Gaye."
"Thine hands are too full to take the bouquet!"
"Thou hast a lot of gall attempting to buy something from my shop without enough gold in thy possession!"
"Speak not of thy deed! Such deeds must deeds receive to equal their merit."
"It is written in the Ophidian runes, of course. But thou canst use the Lens of Translating to aid thee in reading it."
"But this is not what I expected..."
"Dost thou know of Wilfred the Slayer?"
"Thou dost not know the half of it! One time I was passing time at the Blue Boar while Frigidazzi was there."
"Do not thou give me false hopes, stranger! I see no arrow..."
"'Tis a very dirty bottle. Thou didst find this in the woods?"
"And where else but Moonshade wilt thou find a spell in this land? But they are a closed-mouthed lot -- I wish thee luck."
"which, unlike the Bears, prefer to rely on our wits rather than brute strength -- "
"Fedabiblio teaches the young mages. He keeps the library of magic. He knows the history. Speak to him, do not bother me!"
"I have few customers, but perhaps people are beginning to take an interest."
"I regret that we were unable to wrest his body from those vile murderers. Ardiniss deserved a proper warrior's funeral."
"I would be most happy to enchant the hourglass. After freeing the ether, I am most indebted to thee. Let me see it..."
"Thou dost not have enough gold for that!"
"It produces Bloodspawn when mixed with a quantity of blood... Well, I am getting ahead of myself."
"I am so glad that thou hast recaptured the Helm of Monitor. Thou dost make a fine Champion Knight in thine own right."
"The Oracle says the storms are a result of permitting the heretics within the city gates."
"Since thou didst slay the Wolf in the Test, thou art slated to receive the Mark of the Wolf."
"Please consult me when I am not on duty."
"I have not seen Elizabeth or Abraham since they were here last."
"No one prepares fish better than my Petra!"
"I shall make a list of the strange things I have found in my packs. Perhaps these are clues to where our real belongings have gone."
"After a further period of time, earthquakes will begin to tear the land apart... Until it at last destroys itself."
"'Tis done!"
"Fate is a force that is eternal. This is why those of my kind can never truly die."
"What wouldst thou like?"
"I know we have a strong kinship now. We shall be like sisters."
"My fee for training is 75 gold. Does this meet with the approval of thy purse strings?"
"Pray tell, what be the password?"
"Too bad. Thou should try some."
"She is more quiet. Yet she is not unaffected by the often lonely life of a Monitor knight."
Reader, for thy sake and thy thirst for knowledge, I have decided to provide thee with the following accounts.
You see a fighter with intense eyes and a serious disposition.
"Well, I haven't actually seen him for some time. I assume he is still continuing his studies."
You see a broad-shouldered man with a solemn look about him.
"I say, I say who is that? Art thou a stranger?"
"That is because the Avatar is one my dearest friends."

"Good day, Delin... Ah, the Oracle is the other way."
"Do not tell Devra... She will think her son hath gone soft in the head for giving thee a price like this."
"Thou shouldst stay out of this, woman..."
"But we would be doing far better if the goblins had not found Unity under the leadership of Pomdirgun."
"As for Columna, she is only one-third his age! And such an attractive woman..."
"How many wouldst thou like?"

"Thou art already close in skill to me! Thou hast peaked in thine own potential. There is nothing further I can do for thee."
"It grieves me to say this, but there must be a traitor in Monitor. Someone must have revealed our plans to the Goblins."
"And when they lose -- which they must, since Luther is such a powerful brute -- he gloats over them."

"Now that Rotoluncia is dead -- and I shall miss her, for she and I were once lovers -- I hope for greater harmony."
"The very antithesis of Beauty! Goblins are base savages with no appreciation of Beauty and no grasp of Beauty's truth."
"But no one knows where the Goblin village lies. 'Tis an evil mystery..."
"To want how many?"
"Thou hast already experienced the power of the Storms of Imbalance. As time passes, these will increase in frequency and strength."
"My name is Camille, Avatar. It is an honor to meet thee."

"Probably the work of the Goblins -- I have heard that they are most crude, though they do not bother us here on this island."
"'Twas just here..." he scratches his chin. "Oh well, never mind."
"Here something to reward good deed."
"Thou dost say my son has admitted to stealing the venom?! I do not know what to say. My thanks, Avatar, for uncovering the truth."
"I am afraid that I must be able to see them to examine them."
"Suspicious, in fact..."
"Most of it is collected in the pit where the hydra sits. Thou shalt have to ask the hydra about it. It is true!"
"Oh, then art thou not the clever one!"
"I am working to become a great master. Someday I hope to be as great as Master Filbercio."
"Seest thou, Jendon, not everyone is as hard-hearted as thee!"

"Job?! Who can work when he has a broken heart?!"
"He remains a prisoner out of time, imprisoned within the Shrine that is his home."
"As shall I...."
"I had not expected a stranger to know of my tiny industry. I weave the nets and sew in my father's shop."
"Now that he is returned to Moonshade, we have already seen to it that he shall die for what he tried to do to us."
"No? Then thou art a -loaf-er! Ha ha ha!"
"What could I do?"
"Thou mayest find him somewhere within our camp."

"Thou dost not have the guilders to buy that!"
"I was frightened during that storm when Edrin disappeared. But it weren't nothing compared to that sea crossing in Hawk's ship."
"Allow me to introduce the others. First, my fellow members on the Council of Mages. Adept Gustacio..."
The winged gargoyle in front of you has a wild look about him.
"Join me over a bottle of Fawn's finest ale and we can swap tales. I'd like ta know how a beauty like thee came away with a tattoo."
"Hast thou noticed the lightning? It comes in many colors, and it hath sinister magical properties!"
"That is unfortunate. I had hoped to stump thee with my riddles. Later, perhaps, thou wilt change thy mind."
"I am also pleased to say that Leon supports us, as do the other Fellowship members."
"I can give thee 2 gold coins for every 3 guilders thou hast."
"And thou art the most beautiful creature I have ever seen."
"However, he might be sending thee to another ambush! Hmmm..."
"His name is Rankin. I do not believe he has been here terribly long."
"My fate is certain!"
"The Knights of Monitor have repelled such Goblin aggressions successfully in the past and they shall do so again."
"No mortal can resist the Dance of Passion! Tell me that thy blood hath been stirred to a frenzy!"
"Thou -must- free me and we must work together in battling The Guardian. The fate of thy people depends upon it. Dost thou accept?"

"Perhaps I should have referred to her as Commander, for that is what she is... Commander of the Rangers."
"Yes, this is pumice -- black in color, rough in texture, light in weight."
"Their leader, Brendann, is a profligate. Spending too much time with loose women is bad for a warrior -- mark my words!"
"A decent price."
"Thou wilt not accept this ghoul's offer, wilt thou, Avatar?"
"He is in charge of managing the mines. Does a fair job, too. He usually joins me at the Gilded Lizard."
"Thou art most generous! I accept."
"'Tis a lie! Besides, thou art afraid of him as well!"
"And food... Food would be good. Yurel is very hungry."

"What wouldst thou like?"
"Any of the three Serpents shall do, though the Serpent of Chaos would be most appropriate."
"Take thy slick ways elsewhere then! I have more important things to do!"
Once thou dost have the Forces of Order in thy life thou shouldst have no fear.
"Yes, I am part of a family. The Silverleaf tree is my home. I am bonded with Trellek."
"The Blackrock Serpents... thou must have the three Serpents of Blackrock."
"Which coin dost thou care to exchange for filari?"
"These temples are awful old. I hope thou knowest what thou art doing."
"In Monitor, women may be warriors... But at the cost of their femininity."
"These leaves are now scarce, as the Varo grows only with abundant sunlight, and we have had clouded skies for many months."
"Aye, I have. But I'll be tarred if there is one detailing various drinking establishments!"
"She does not love me, I know. She would rather marry a rich man. I have not a chance."
"Petra, come and hear this! The customer jests with me!"
"Ya! Brom he is my master. If he vishes me to do someting, I must do it! If he does not vant me to do someting, I must not do it!"
"Father must charge reasonably high prices or we will be made paupers!"

"No longer must a Mage or Mundane be bound by petty rules. It is quite exciting!"

"Bwundai my name is."
"Do not fool thyself to think that they Might be a pretty robe."
"As thou hast won back the helm of Monitor, thou art truly deserved of the title Champion Knight of Monitor. I salute thee!"

"I accept thine offer. And did I say how much of a pleasure it is doing business with thee?"
"I do not know who is responsible, the monks or Xenka herself, but I sometimes feel as if I could strike someone!"
"To give me your answer -- will you bring me the Goblet of the Conjury?"

"Then bring it to me!"
"Xenka was the greatest of us all."
"Knights, have you been listening? Our new warrior hath had a terrible experience..."

"I am Denby."
"Come, Palos! Destiny awaits beyond the frozen mountains!"
"See how I reward those who fail me!"
"Avatar, thou shalt fail!"
"Although I know it would be wrong, I wish with all mine heart that thou wouldst not. If I could join thee, I would gladly."
"I teach others to be strong fighters. I am a trainer here in Vesper."
"Katrina is a shepherd here on New Magincia. She has been a friend of mine since I was a boy."

"Thou dost not have a spellbook."
"Some other time, then."
"I cannot say why you humans do the things you do: you are peculiar creatures, with odd customs and strange rituals."
"Frankly, I do so many things. I am Monitor's treasurer. Lord Marsten may order things done, but I must find a way to pay for it all!"
"If thou wilt look, thou wilt find thou dost already have that spell!"
"My name is Diane."
"It seems that I cannot put the serpent in the slot. Perhaps I should step up a level..."

"Perhaps another time, then."
"Honey will be given by you to me?"
"If thou shouldst ever need a sextant be sure to come back."

"How many suits of scale armour wouldst thou care to sell?"
"I have business to attend to. Be quick."
"Excellent! Thou canst start work immediately! I shall pay thee 5 gold for every five loaves of bread thou dost make. All right?"
"Is that the area they believe is the Goblin rendezvous? I do not believe it. I have never seen Goblins there."
"I shall attempt to wait for thee here, but if I cannot, where shall we meet?"
"Thou hast called but one person... No doubt thy trust in the Oracle's perception will be rewarded."
"Seth, the healer, patched me up right enough, but that were the end of me sea-goin' days."
"I feel terrible, for this time I had given away mine heart, and now 'tis broken..."
"If thou dost meet me at the Place of the Test, thou canst take the Test of Knighthood."

"Thou hast not met the great Ensorcio yet? Count thy blessings!"
"The Arabella is a fine ship... Good lines and fast-running before a stiff breeze."
"I see that thou art a member of The Fellowship!"
"But we have barely begun, Avatar! How can I stand idly here while the adventure awaits?"
"Indeed, thou art from a distant land if thou dost not know such a common term."
"Back, creature of the undead! Thou art a thing of evil!"
"I am sure that thou hast already..." ~"Wouldst thou like to hear it again?"
"I hate even to utter his name... It leaves a bitter taste in the mouth!"
"Another night, then."
"Or perhaps I should say @donation@!"
"I see no more."
"'Tis the skull of some beast, obviously. Perhaps it is a Goblin skull -- I would be glad of that."
"'Courage is the Soul of Life.'"
"I can give thee 3 guilders for every 1 monetari thou hast."
"Job? I have not the time for a job. I am on a quest to rid this land of that which plagues it!"

You hand the gold over to Boris.
"In which circle dost thou wish to study?"
"Allow me to see that bottle. But of course! This is Moonshade wine, made by the Rangers of our town!"
"Kylista, the levers have been set, and the traitor's fate is sealed..."
"Monitorian females, on the other hand, are as strong as oxen!"
"Hmmm... Perhaps we could arrange private instruction..."
"Another stranger! Most suspicious. There have not been many travellers recently."
"Those are my wife's stockings! Oh, vile fiend! To think that thou wouldst flaunt Columna's indiscretion in my face! After I trusted thee!"
"Never seen 'em. Never wanted to."
"'Tis forbidden to help thee directly, stranger. Thou must discern things for thyself."

"When thou hast placed each correctly, a flame of Chaos shall appear as thy sign."
"That is when he leaves his laboratory to go out into the city."
"I died of a broken heart, waiting for thy return..."
"To be good. To want to sell nothing to you."
"It seems that thou hast not enough gold. Do return when thou art a bit wealthier."
"This would give us the chance to find and steal the source of Draygan's power. Unless we do this, I am doomed to be his slave."
"But beware of Goblins! They come ever closer to the city of late. Even the bravest warrior can be slain if ambushed..."
"Then thou must go back to the Isle of the Phoenix!"
"Thank thee Avatar for thine help. Thou hast given me back my life."
"Lest anyone be confused, let me state unequivocably that Daemons exist. Evil is real!"
"But did I hear thee say 'Avatar?' Say not that thy leader is the one -true- Avatar!"
"Thou cannot possibly carry that much!"
"One more time then..."
"Dear guests, I am afraid that I shall have to adjourn this pleasant repast."
"Avatar! Save me!"
"To charge 50 gold for each training session. To be all right?"
"I have seen our friend rarely over the years. I understand he has been spending most of his time in Trinsic."
"The Knights of Monitor are organized into three clans, which are called Commands."
"I hope never to find if it is true..."
"How may I aid thee, Avatar?"
"I paid them well enough! But I did not expect them to waylay Hawk to rot in some jail cell!"
"Those who call themselves Britannians -- the sailors that dwell outside the city gates to the northeast -- are false prophets!"
"But I stand condemned, for the key is lost!"
"Poor Topo! Someday he'll be the Master Artisan, but for now he must labor long hours for a mere pittance."

"What suits thy fancy?"
"Thy companions will have to help thee with this burden."
"Oddly aloof creatures. They have made good messengers in the past."
"Perhaps thou art not truly serious about thy convictions. Mayhaps Daphne will take thy line of bets."
"No, that doth not look like my shield. I do not believe I have ever seen that shield before in my life."
"No offense intended, Iolo!"
"Siranush! I had despaired of seeing thee again! How I wish I could be with thee always..."
"I need thy protection."
"Joth is a good man, with a fine sense of what needs to be done to keep the fleets in good order."

"Petre the stables caretaker discovered poor Christopher and Inamo early this morning."
"We hated the object, yet we were afraid to be parted from it. I cannot explain this. But it was so."
"Agreeable?"
"He says his name is Max."
"Thou hast the Comb of Beauty! Wilt thou give me the Comb? I will grant thee Fawn's greatest treasure, as I promised the heavens."
"I know no more than that. I must concern myself with trying to provide Fawn with food."
"Ah... My prices are fair here. Fair indeed."
"I do hope I shall be of some assistance to thee as I travel with thee during thine adventures! I am having quite a bit of fun, actually."

"No job is had by me."
"Frighten a saucy thing that wears a tattoo? Now where was I? Oh, yes..."
"True, they do not compare to thee, but I am not too selective in my tastes. One flesh is as good as another when one hungers."
"Now let us eat, and as we do so, let us extend our fellowship to this new Knight."
"I am studying the effects of a particular substance known as silver snake venom. But I am encountering a number of difficulties."
"To wonder why you bothered me."
"But if thou spokest with Master Ducio, perhaps he could help thee. He makes all of the apparatus for the wizards of Moonshade."
"His name is Auston. I like him, but I suspect that Liana is the one who truly keeps Vesper in order."
"To reward thee I can shall give thee a valuable secret."
"Voldin works in conjunction with the Captain of the Guard to assure Fawn's safety. He is senior on the council."
"I do not have much demand for it around here, though. The sailors don't care much for such a weak vintage -- Fawn folk prefer Fawn ale!"
"The northern trees produce tough cones which are filled with seeds. Later, the cones open and release their seeds."
"Oh, I do not know. It has been so long since I was personally involved in such matters. Art thou seeking love or art thou seeking lust?"
Batlin's eyes open wide in surprise.
"To be unwilling to allow the ring to fall into the wrong hands. To say that the Dream warns of the deceitfulness of the Spectral Trinity."
"I love thee... And I shall dream of thee all the rest of my days." *"Farewell..."
"Meats are from killed animals. Killing is bad. Destroying is bad."
"No, but thank thee for asking."
"Thou dost not have the monetari to pay me!"

"If only her father were here today, he would show that loathsome creature his place!"
"Now bring the animal's body to Cellia the Furrier. From the carcass, she shall make thy Cloak of Knighthood."
"Perhaps Rotoluncia hath gone there to hide, and taken thy friend as well. If so, then she hath betrayed me."

"Keth and I were to marry, but it was not fated to be."
"Failure in StartTournament() because we couldn't pop an item into the chest."
"I am Mikos."
"At any rate, what dost thou desire to speak of?"
"Or perhaps one of the Mages hath been experimenting again in the forbidden arts."
"Thou art a leadpate even worse than Vasel! Go and finish thy task and return to me!"
"It sounds like thou art describing a bear skull. Bears are usually found in the south and west."
"Returned again?"
"If thou canst not pay, please leave!"
"Arrogant people down there. Always wantin' ta beat thee. They have a big walled city south of here. Monitor is where the Pikemen are from."
"To need a little more persuasion," he looks down, "but to be almost ready to join!"
"As thou must know by now, my creator chose to call me Adjhar."
"It is my rightful property and I shall have it back!"

"Perhaps, after thou hast completed thy task, I couldst think of a way for thee to make it up to me."
"What coinage dost thou desire?"
"No, no, no. How could a mere mortal snatch thy friend in such an arcane fashion?"
"I wonder... Caladin hath been angry because the ashes of his grandfather were missing. Perhaps that is what that urn contains."
"Free! Free! Free at last!"
"To have once been a great mind. To be now paranoid and reclusive. To feel pity for Wis-Sur."
"My name is Beryl. I need thine help, but I cannot speak now..."
Day 28 -- The men are upset that no gold hath been found...
"I am the healer of the residents of this community."
"I thank thee for showing me this document. Justice will be served. Thou mayest keep this document if thou wishest."
"And what didst thou learn?"
"Perhaps thou hast heard the name Rotoluncia?"
"I knew thou didst lack Discipline!"
"Very well!"
"To despair for my people, for they are lost in slumbers and the Dream. Only I remain."
"To seem to recognize you, as if from the vision of my slumbers... To wonder if you are the Hero of the Dream..."
"Some Pikeman will be looking for this."
"It would appear thou dost not have enough gold for that!"
"The time is not right. I cannot see thee now. Another time, my love..."
"I have been awaiting thine arrival..."
"But no one can tell Luther anything."
"I think he is worried about the thief. After all, Spektor is the town treasurer, so when money starts disappearing, everyone suspects him."
"So, thou art returned... Failed in thy puny quest already, hero?"
"She is a changed woman, I think. Hast thou visited her in her cell?"
"Wouldst thou aid us in liberating this city from false traditions and evil schemes?"
"Hast thou reconsidered my request, Avatar? Wilt thou bring to me the Dream Crystal?"
"That is a grievous tale! But surely the time for grief is past. Thou art in the company of great companions."
"No more questions..."
"For a gold coin I will tell thee another. Dost thou wish to hear it?"
"How nice! All right! I shall give thee a clue. 'Tis here in this scroll."

"I think he was more disturbed by thine abrupt departure than he cared to show."
"Petra is a surprisingly good cook, considering that she is an automaton."
"What can I tell thee that thou dost not already know?"
"I shall be happy to serve thee something if thou dost come to the pub during open hours!"
"Excellent! Let me see it."
"Then why dost thou waste my time?! Go back to those fool Ophidians, where thou dost belong!"
Strength feeds on Ethics and Ethics on strength.
"Or think what a fine gift this would be for Lord British! He would be impressed, to be sure."
"No offense, but he was also a member of The Fellowship!"
"Later, perhaps... handsome stranger."
"If thou art a Mage, thou must follow the Strictures. If thou art a Mundane, thou must not overly annoy a Mage. That much is simple logic."
"There is a cave further south by a large red bush -- its entrance is invisible. If thou canst find thy way in, it may provide more clues."
"Thou art tough... like an ol' sailor!"
"It does not work well. I do not understand it."
"I served thee well upon the Isle of Fire! Why hast thou brought me to this cold place?"
"She our chieftain. Gwani people always led by females. Yenani good friend of Gwenno."
"So thou art healthy? 'Tis good news. If thou dost need my services in the future, do not hesitate to return."
"In truth there are few places where I have not been and little that I have not done."
"I am sorry to say~"I have called it a day.~"Come to the grounds to test thy fitness~"when I am, yea verily, open for business."
"To have another offer?"
"So he rode up to the mystics and asked, 'Art thou truth-tellers?'"
"It sounds simply horrid. Templar may know of such things, but I do not."
"Our prices are honest here at the Sleeping Bull!"
"I am sorry. A better time to discuss this would be when my shop is open."
"Return to the Temple! The secret room which thou hast seen must have some influence over the Oracle."
"This same wave of amnesia struck me every time I tried to approach the tetrahedron. I do not know what sort of foul magic this is."
"Perhaps the Magister could help thee. He is an authority on many subjects."
"Thou art a fine one ta be talkin' about being taken in, Jendon. An' I've said so often enough."
"It is good of thee to help that poor Sprellic fellow in his hour of need."
"Why, that is unthinkable! I have never heard of such a preposterous thing!"
"Especially since we would help them build an empire of sin and gluttony out of Buccaneer's Den."
"Fawnish ale -- phew! A horrible brew."
"That is too bad. However, if we learn anything, we shall inform thee."
"He doth tell of something wonderful, wherein all people are equal and capable of independent thought. Something called The Fellowship."
"Mortegro doth have an interest in Death, and goodness knows what the Mad Mage might be doing!"

"Yes, we met at the MageLord's banquet. I am Frigidazzi, of course."
"Thou shouldst submit thyself to the trial, for the time being. That is mine advice."
"I can see that thou art unsure of how to progress, great Hero... That is why I am here."
"To answer to For-Lem."
"The ruins left by the Daemons who once dwelt in this land?"
"Oh, not that ale tale again, Olon! If thou drivest away what customers I have left, thou canst find somewhere else ta drink."
"He was a member of The Fellowship, too!"
"The goblins are most likely preparing for an assault on our city."
"What sort of items art thou inquiring about?"
"We serve the finest meat, fish, and cake. Our specialty is a Silverleaf meal. If thou wouldst like to buy something, please say so!"
"Dost thou need the password?"
"But we agreed to be partners. From now on, thou and I are inseparable!"
"So thou hast spoken to that hag! Tell me now -- dost thou believe me, or she?"
"The Emerald is pleased to serve thee the finest cuisine this side of Britain. Thou mightest wish to try the special -- Silverleaf."
"Such an unusual bottle... Perhaps Lucilla can identify it for thee."
"Please, Avatar, I simply must know."
"What is thy concern?"
"Yes, well, I did not wish to get this personal with thee, but if thou does not mind, art thou a virgin?"
"Look closer. Dost thou see the patterns which adorn my body, the swirls of color? Each doth have its meaning..."
"Salamon is the wisest Emp. Humans have been met by her. -Many- things have been seen by her. She is very experienced and knowledgeable."
"By hopelessly miring my visions in the bog of high and mighty language, they have delayed thee until it is nearly too late."
"I do admit, I was impressed. I could not help but think about the trouble that Rotoluncia was having."
"Thou hast no such object! Do not waste my time, for I am a busy man..."
"No, no! This is not chicken feed that thou dost handle!"
"I shall miss thee if thou dost not return..."
"Failure in BrendanUsable(_Polymorph) because we couldn't find the door."
"But a man cannot be convicted simply for strange habits! We must have evidence..."
"What wouldst thou like to buy?"
"I sell and collect weapons of all types. Business is always excellent, although my best customers keep getting killed in duels!"
"It is said that Erstam translated portions of it, but the translation was lost many years ago."
"Then be on thy way! Marsten is the traitor -- what a lark!"
"Actually, I do not like this town very much. The people here are all poor and the only one mine own age is Tobias."
"But I don't believe it."
"My profession -- rather, my destiny -- is to learn and know all things. I came to New Magincia to build my workshop and do so."
"To be Runeb."
"I am also one of the best combat trainers in the land, shouldst thou need such aid."
"I think so, too."
"What dost thou say?"
"Failure in CleanUpTournament() because we couldn't pop an item into the student's inventory."
"No doubt the bottle belongs to that traitor, Krayg."
"Not having met the man, I have little to say about him. He needs a shave."
"Batlin must be told of this! If he returns to Britannia to explain to Lord British, I am sure that everything will be settled."
"I'd throw thee out, if thou weren't mine only steady customer. I would."
"Even as I let the Comb of Beauty slip from the city, I have let all of Fawn slip into lifeless darkness!"
"Withdraw thy suspicions -- I vouch for his integrity. Mortegro did not steal thy friend."
"Remember me, if thou dost ever need any more furs!"
"But I am certain that thou hast heard of me!"
"Luther is the worst! Thou didst hear him! He doth accuse me of being a traitor."
Believe me reader, when I listened to this, I shuddered with awe...
"If there is anything thou dost want in the way of bows and arrows, please say so!"
"I thought thou wert in need of my produce!"
"I offered to sell them a ship, but they had no money. They actually seemed offended when I would not give it to them for free!"
"I am grateful for thy sympathy, madam. I too am attracted to thee. Aha, thou didst not think I noticed thy glances!"
"There are many rare and fine things to be bought here in my shop. Bargains to be had nowhere else in all of Britannia."
"Fedabiblio keeps the library here in Moonshade. All information, whether historical or magical in nature, finds its way to his hands."
"Thou cannot possibly carry that much!"
"Have they stopped looking for monsters yet? Can Yurel go home in peace now?"
"Hast thou seen our wine press? We are very proud of it."
"I understand that thou art busy on thy quest, Avatar."
"She mate of Myauri all of life. She not only leader of Gwani people, but keeper of stories, and history of our people."

"The healers say his back will never be the same again. He can never go back to sea."
"I have none so long as I am left to rot here in this prison."
"Perhaps some other time, then."
"Then thou art destined for a dismal life, my friend. For the world is what thou makest of it. Thou canst acquire only what thou takest."
"I hate that monster! He represents all that is evil!"
"Now place the Eyes of the Serpent before my statue."
"I would quickly have to beg if I offered such prices every day!"
"If thou dost wish an audience with her, I can examine her schedule."
"What of our bargain? I thought better of thee..."
"They live in the snowlands of the far north, where the Goblins sometimes go to war on them."
"I was named after a famous Phoenix queen. She was so beautiful that a dragon came to court her!"

"Oh, I hope that thou dost attempt the Knight's Test! And when thou dost, please come back to tell me about it!"
"The troll beats me many times during the day. I will not be able to survive for much longer."
This beautiful, earthy woman in her forties gives you a friendly smile.
"The Blue Boar doth have the finest prices, eh?"
"What is your liberty worth?"
"Vicious beast! This Ice Dragon is mother protecting its babies."
"Why, it is a gambling parlor! The Fellowship certainly takes in a bundle from that place!"
Be patient in all circumstances. That will make thee wealthy, for each minute is a priceless gem.
"Thou shouldst not travel so heavily burdened -- I do not think that thou canst bear the bottles that thou desirest!"
"'Tis done!"
"We have a cornucopian variety of elixirs to quench thy tongue and gourmet dishes to appease thy palate."
"Ah, but she did tutor me as well, that summer! There have been many loves, before and since, but I shall always remember Rotoluncia."
"Yes, I remember thee from the banquet -- Rotoluncia wanted to kill thee!"
"I hate to say this, but I am relieved to hear that!"
"Yurel had friends. Yurel had a safe place to sleep. Yurel worked hard and had fun. Yurel wants to go home..."
"I drinks ta forget my pain, innkeeper. Go ahead, Avatar. Ask me thy questions."
"I sell armour and weapons here. I have something to meet thine every need. Dost thou wish to see armour or weapons?"
"Hail, friend. I hope that I may assist thee in some way."
"Failure in StartTournament() because we couldn't find the chest."
"My mother grows grain."
"Art thou certain of thy facts?"
"Now that's truly touchin', Olon. Thou surely hast brought a tear ta mine eye, thou hast."
"Obviously, she fears the truths of The Fellowship as much as she fears Pomdirgun."
"He is proud and skilled hunter."
"Nothing at all? Well, alright."
"Anything else for thee today?"
"Art thou in need of food or healing?"
"Seek the Temple, and within it, the Eye of the Moon."
"Perhaps thou shouldst inquire of Bucia at the Provisioner's Shop -- if there is anything to be known in this city, she would know it."

"Three great cities were founded by those who fled the tyrant: Moonshade, Fawn and Monitor."
"I have heard a tale about a mad human who is known as 'The Fiend'. Apparently he is very dangerous."
"Those are very interesting, but too daring for a nice girl to wear, methinks."
"We meet again."
"Dost thou wish... to return to the mainland?"
"Oh, my. Thou canst not possibly carry that many gold coins. Thou must return when thou dost have more space in thy pack."
"Thou shouldst not stay overlong outside the city walls, even if Kylista refuses refuge to me and my companions."
"What art thou saying to that stranger, Beryl?"
"To be the Captain of the guard. To serve and protect the people of Serpent's Hold."
"Voldin be the eldest of the three Great Captains. They say he's a wise man, but I do not much care for him."
"Actually, there are no other inns or pubs in Paws. It is a small place, but our food and drink here is quite good, honestly."
"Which coin dost thou care to exchange for gold?"
"It was the duty of Number 7 to keep the key to the fountain room. It hath been quite a while since we last saw Number 7."
"Hard to believe, is it not?"
"The Blue Boar inn. 'Tis in the northern part of the city, just west of the Palace. Many of the Mages eat there as well."
"Sorry, milady."
"I am Garritt, the son of Feridwyn and Brita."
"Yah! I came to Britannia t'rough vone ov de Moongates, de same as thee. Dat vas many, many years ago."

"`Job' is not understood. Family is what you mean?"
"These are the people I saw!"
"I think Boydon hath been created rather well! Thou hast done an excellent job in assisting me in his creation."
"The problem lies with the Bears and Wolves -- their bickering weakens us. So I had a plan! The Leopards would rule, and I would be King."
"Aye, the bugs have a weakness: they are especially vulnerable to fire. I fried dozens of the monsters before they broke ranks and ran!"
"I knew that thou wouldst perceive the ethicality of this Cause, given time. If thou hast questions, I shall be glad to answer them."
"I fashion my arrows from the stingers of giant bees. With them one may put a foe to sleep."
"To have dreamed of dying infants, of minds numbed or gone insane, and of beings which simply waste away due to the Imbalance."
"When my bust is complete, then my fame will be perfect and they shall surely proclaim me Knight Champion!"
"It was once a large town, but now, 'tis but a smattering of cottages livin' throughout the woods."
You see a fat, cheerful-looking merchant.
"Take that thing out of here!" ~"My patrons are trying to eat!"
"I do not know what thou art talking about."
"One sent by the Soldiers of Order, to break our wills and stop the Ode to Chaos. Why else dost thou listen so attentively?"
"As thou hast now seen, the peril that faces Cantra doth go beyond merely being taken by the Goblins. Some foul thing doth possess her."
"Canst thou imagine? After many rejections, she at last agreed to go away with him. And then she flew away with the dragon, into the sky!"
"I wish to win some money at Buccaneer's Den. It is a pirate resort and they have a fabulous House of Games there."
"Thou wilt encounter them. My mother cooks in the kitchen. My prudish sister is the chambermaid."
"But we would be doing far better if the goblins had not found Unity under the leadership of Pomdirgun."
"I belong to the Temple of Emotion."
"Hmmm. Well, Sir Richter has changed much recently -- ever since he joined The Fellowship. He seems a little less compassionate."
"I can give thee 20 gold coins for every 1 gold nugget thou hast."
"We do not have city gates to hide behind."
"My name is not important."
I seem to have lost the Serpent Tooth I took from the Mad Mage.
"Very good. At last we are getting somewhere!"
"An engagement ring!"
"No one in this town ever really hated the gypsies, at least not that I have ever been aware of. Who could have done such a thing?"
"I am glad that traitor Spektor hath been arrested!"
"I have no wish to bind thee here, for all that I love thee. I will live my life and pray to meet thee beyond this world."
"If thou wilt come to my shop when I am at work, I shall be happy to grant thee thy Mark of Knighthood."
"He takes the morning watch at the dock."
"Well, years ago, there was experimenting aplenty amongst the mages. There were not nearly as many restrictions as there are now."
"Very vell."
"Upon completing Knight's Test there is a ceremony wherein one's totem animal is chosen. It is always either a wolf, a leopard or a bear."
"Enough of this jabbering. Let justice be done!"
"To be unable to travel with that much weight!"
"Do not look back, or the explosions will overcome thee. Move swiftly at first."
"An' I suppose that thou considerest the island of cats a tragedy then?"
"Art thou sure this man is not really the jester?"
"pay no mind to what he may say. Morghrim is an evil and depraved man. Thou shouldst avoid him like the plague."
"I have devoted mine entire life to this, nothing will get in my way, not even Batlin."
"I have mine own suspicions. Take a close look at Krayg. He seems to spend a lot of time in the woods on long walks... alone."
"I am Zorn."
"Perhaps another time, then."
"I must stop thee, before thou sendest us all to our doom!"
"I'd advise against it, lady. There aren't many outside Fawn that care for its taste, I've found. I only export a bit ta Monitor now."
"Let us press on, Avatar!"
"To be honored to see you, Avatar of Virtue! To be certain that you are the Hero we have dreamed about."
"I am so glad thou art my brother in The Fellowship; I know I may trust thee. It is all of the others in this town that I worry about."
"Well, he is a killer. Some think he is the one responsible for the murder that happened last year."
"Aye, thou wilt see many of them strewn about as thou dost look around the manor."
"Such an odd couple! Melino is one of our eldest Mages, retired from the Council. He is a good man, but often befuddled."
"Hard to believe a good man like Dupre would be in league with Daemon British..."
"Sir Pendaran is a knight of the Hold. He is very friendly, but I have been told he can be overbearing at times."
"I beg of thee, for thy sake as well as the sake of my missing child, look into the glass."
"Avatar! Why art thou in my dream? I was looking for Gwenno..."
"Long ago, there lived a maid As fair as a summer morn."
"I am Jergi. Pleased to make thine acqvaintance."
"The monks have recorded all of Xenka's visions. They keep this tome of wisdom within their Chapel, on the altar."
"What coinage dost thou desire?"
"Forgive me. I have no questions for thee."
"Return to the tower with this new energy globe!"
"I am supremely jealous of her affections, as well. Though I do not truly love her, I will not be made a fool of!"
"With what coinage dost thou wish to pay?"
"Oh. Oh well," he shrugs in an attempt at indifference. "She was not truly important anyway."
"That looks like the sort of equipment used by Erstam, the Mad Mage! He lives at the place called Mad Mage Island."
"He is the Fellowship branch leader. Kind man."
"Dost thou want the location of the city or to know about the townspeople?"
"Thou couldst see if Hawk is at the Blue Boar. He's a sailor and might know more than a man who's never left this island."
"To have only a few gargoyles living in town. To know mainly Wis-Sur and Ansikart, and to know of some wingless ones."
"So! Thou hast discovered me!"
"Now that I have explained it, thy duty must be evident. Wilt thou join us in this Cause?"
"I had always hoped that one day I would be able to make a pilgrimage there, but now it shall have to wait until after the war."
"My fee will leave thee with nothing!"
"According to this, thou shouldst have the victim drink the water from the temple dedicated to that virtue which the person lacks."
"Lydia was a strange woman, beautiful but dangerous."
"While I am far too busy to sit on the Council, I am well-connected, nonetheless. Many Mages come to consult me during their research."
"Such offense to Beauty cannot go unpunished... The stain of their presence must be washed away with their blood."
"Only now do I see that it was the tradition, the duty, that I tossed aside as worthless. And now it is lost forever!"
"Ah, my least favorite subject. I find the trees much less interesting than the birds."
"Dost thou agree to my rate?"
"Art thou certain? Thou shalt find no better ships in all of Britannia! Very well, then!"
"Thou hast not heard of the Mad Mage?!"
"He travelled with many companions, including a tall, cloaked stranger."
"What? Thou dost know who did betray Astrid to the Goblins! How dost thou know? Tell me now!"
"I am sorry, but I must make a living."
"We shall behave ourselves, milord. The Fellowship is an enlightened brotherhood, not a group to be feared."
"Perhaps someone could identify the bottle, if thou wert to show it around. Lucilla at the pub might recognize it."
"What can I get ye?"
"Like when thou didst retrieve the Helm of Monitor from that vile Pomdirgun."
"Doth that not sound nice?"
"To be good. To be hoping to hear from him soon."
"Pardon me, but my dinner is wasting. We can talk again later."
"So, thou didst finally think to return, King? It is too late! All are dead, the Goblins conquered all..."
"What can it hurt, Kylista, to speak again to the great Oracle?"
"We were all very thankful that he was so strong, I tell thee that."
You see a scholarly-looking man with a friendly expression.
"No! Thou canst not escape that easily!"
"Then one day Keth didn't run fast enough ta shelter when one of those cursed storms hit. No one hath seen him since."
"But perhaps time runs differently here than in Britannia."
"Good... Dead it is!"
"I have been looking forward to thine arrival, Avatar. Word spreads quickly. I am pleased to meet thee!"
"My fee will leave thee with nothing!"
"I thought we had an agreement!"
"Forgive me, lord, but I, too, have a serious matter to put before the leaders of Monitor."
"In which circle dost thou wish to study?"
"I know! If thou art about to reveal some important secret, I shall signal thee by clapping sharply. Then thou shouldst be silent."
"Silence, please! We shall now listen to the song of the Void, which whispers of events both past and present..."
"Hmmm. And does thy wife know thou art seeing Candice home?"
"My name is Ellen."
"I'm sorry, but that is not the correct answer."
"The Rangers have a magic winepress. It works without need of human assistance. I am sure that thou wilt find it interesting."
"I did mistrust thy words previously, Alyssand, but now that Kylista hath confessed... I know not what to believe."
"I had thought to give it to thee as a token of my love."
"Two men and a woman. Their names are Timmons, Vokes, and Syria. Respectively."
"Dost thou agree to my rate?"
"Do not give me false hopes, stranger! I see no King's Savior."
"Dost thou want to buy more armour?"
"Ophelia this! Ophelia that! That is all I ever hear all bloody day! If all thou dost want to talk about is her, talk to someone else!"
"If only thou wert a Knight! Then I could let thee vouch for thy friend, and let him free."
"She is the branch clerk. Most of the time, she is friendly. Sometimes, however, she seems a little cold."
"Thou wouldst know him, if thou hadst met him. He is the ultimate Order warrior! Nothing touches him. He is bound only by his duty."
"Oh, nothing is ever new in New Magincia, as the joke around here goes. But that is how we like it. We have few visitors here."
"Hast thou heard the rumor about the apothecary? Some say that he hath a most uncanny resemblance to the Mad Mage."
"Thou wishest to buy a bouquet?"
"Fedabiblio is the master of novices here in Moonshade. It is his lamentable duty to try and make those miscreants into Mages!"
"To know of many gargoyles who work in the other mines, but to see the Vesper mine has only humans now."
"Oh. To not have amulet with you." He perks up and smiles. "To return later with amulet!"
"This group is getting a little large for my tastes. I think I'll stay at the Inn for a while..."
"This is a time of war! Thou canst not think to wander about unchallenged. 'Twould be a breach of duty if I did not stop and question thee."
"Filbercio is a presumptuous maggot who calls himself MageLord of Moonshade!"
"I must be going. Pressing town business, that sort of thing."
"I haven't seen one that size since the last time we sailed around that big forest north of here. They were all over there."
"I am Luther! I am a Bear and a trainer of unequalled strength. It is my destiny to become the next Knight Champion of Monitor!"
"Avatar! At last thou hast come. Seeing thee again hath brought me strength."
"Oh, but I cannot leave thee now! I have pledged to show thee the resting place of the Hierophant, and I shall not disappoint thee."
"But I escaped and Rocco took me in."
"But we were soon to hear the best part..."
"Thou dost not have enough gold for that!"
"'Tis our wine, sure enough! Can't fool my nose after all these years working with the Mad Mage's wine press!"
"There is no shortage of opponents, especially if thou dost go there in the late morning or afternoon."
"Someone must survive the end of the world. That person may as well be me."
You are greeted with a smile from this gargoyle.
"There are fewer and fewer Silverleaf trees. Many are cut down often. Soon, no Silverleaf trees will be around for our homes."
"What spell wouldst thou like to buy?"
"But alas, my duty as a Knight keeps me here in Monitor. The Goblins are a constant threat, even though thou hast slain their king."
"Once I was in love with Henry, the peddler, but then I learned he is a liar and a cad. Perhaps soon mine heart shall belong to another."
"Which of my services dost thou need?"
"'Tis said that he doth have a terrible temper. Luther loses control and simply begins swinging."
"What if I combine all three? Shall I sing a song which is a tale about the people of Cove?"
"Thou couldst not buy even so much as a novice's light spell for that paltry sum! Another offer perhaps..."
"Excuse me, Great Lady, but I must address a point of order."
"Far away from the mire of present day society is where I belong. In the wilderness thou canst know what is what."
"Ah. To donate next time, perhaps."
"Thy best bet in finding that rascal is to look in Britain. He has a girlfriend employed as an actress at the Royal Theatre."
"Art thou travelling to Cove?"
"Hmmm. I cannot imagine... oh yes, I remember. I was taking a walk in that area. I must have been careless and dropped the bottle."
"These days, she keeps to herself and dabbles in magic, canst thou imagine? Hah!"
"I did not see anything..."
"They were to watch for thine arrival, oh mighty Hero, and prepare the people for the approaching danger."
"I am most glad to have Edrin back."
"I learned the trade from my father. Counting myself, there have been twelve generations of tattooists in our family."
"The rooms are upstairs."
"To have visited this place within the Underground City. To be in the north-eastern chambers of the city."
"To Gwani, best way to live -- only way -- to live in harmony with nature. And so we not do anything that force nature."
"As for Spektor, he would rather pick up a quill than a sword. With such leaders, how can the Leopards amount to much!"
"I'm a geographer, sir. And a sailor. Though I was brought here by The Fellowship to study this land, I do not practice their beliefs."
"But thanks to thee I have more respect for her beliefs."
"Very well." *"I accept thine offer!"
"He is my best friend and the bravest man I know."
You see a friendly face looking back at you.
"Art thou investigating this crime against mankind?"
"I had recently begun making the trips with my father when Donal hired her to do the cooking. That was before she married Angus."
"He holds seances regularly. I am certain he will invite thee to one, sooner or later."
"I am Brendann. I did meet thee at the Banquet Hall."
"I can give thee 2 gold coins for every 3 guilders thou hast."
"After all these centuries, we have no intention of changing our sacred beliefs now..."
"Gamblin' is how Robin makes his living. I do not think he has had a regular post in all of his life!"
"Oh. Well, thou must return when thou art hungry."
"I have yet to meet her, but I know she loves animals. I have seen her playing with the deer and squirrels that inhabit this region."
"Morfin is an unusual character. If I did not know any better I would say he was involved with a number of shady business activities."
"Moonglow is on an island directly east of the border between Britain and Paws."
"Hear the woods are overrun by Goblins, these days."
"Oh, horrible, vile creatures! They have killed all the Pikemen that were guarding the road to our beautiful city."
"If thou dost want a ship, thou must get a deed from the shipwright. Thou must also have the password to leave town."
"Then we shall have to work together..."
"But my prices are set, I'm afraid."
"I would rather become a Ranger than accept such an offer!"
"According to all of our traditions, only women are capable of ruling in Fawn -- for only women are capable of True Beauty."
"The owner and proprietor of the Salty Dog, the finest eating and drinking establishment in all of Paws, at thy service."
"Ask Delphynia. She doth know all manner of strange things."
"Big group, many people. You should join!"
"Thou mayest take it then. I hope that thou dost enjoy it."
"Well, ye'll have to come to the shop when it is is open."
"He is most often with his pens and ink, drawing intricate little lines..."
"To know little about it. To like little about it."
"A veritable wonderland, is it not?"
"Hail to Beauty, and the omnipotence of the Oracle!"
"Wouldst thou like something else?"
"Yet even servitude would be better than the damnation that Chaos now endures, with its Forces driven apart and broken."
"I will train thee now."
"All references to the one who can alter the course of destiny allude to the Hero from Another World."
"Yes, many people tell me that. Now thou dost say it, too. If thou dost say so, then it must be true!"
"What dost thou want to know about?"
"Failure in BrendanUsable(_Polymorph) because we couldn't pop a path egg next to the door."
"The Goblins were ready for us, milord! It could not have been by accident."
"Very well... perhaps another time."
"Thou hast potential but thou must pratice, or thou wilt be undone when haste is called for."
"Thou art most rude to renege on an offer!"
"Yes, I have a spellbook stored away with the rest of the equipment."
"I must return to my duties lest the goblin horde take us."
"I have not seen him recently, but the description of the murder scene certainly sounds like his handiwork!"
"A peculiar brush? I suspect that I already know what it is, but let me see..."
"Be ready at any time, for one doth not know when the time to act shall arrive."
"Good luck to thee! With no ships sailing, there is no way to go to Fawn from here."
"Wouldst thou like another spell?"
"Thou dost not know of Bloodspawn? Good!"
"'Tis thy choice... and thy mistake!"
"Yurel knows not what is so special about it. It is pretty. It sat upon a pedestal. So it must have been important."
Unexpectedly, Nastassia pulls your head down to hers and kisses you on the mouth.
"I can give thee 2 gold coins for every 1 monetari thou hast."
"Die in acid!... automaton... fetches Water!"
"Thou art not ready to learn yet!"
"I sense that now is the time to go north. All is ready for thy success."
"To apologize, but I must charge that amount!"
"Why did the chicken cross the road?"
"There was no fever. It seemed as if they were sleeping..."
"What didst thou find?"
"He disappeared some time ago, and is presumed dead. I have been seeking clues since I was notified..."
"Eagh! Thou dost disgust me."
"They brought thee here along their way to Jhelom."
"Would you like another spell?"
You see an impressive winged gargoyle with a stately demeanor.
"The less that thou knowest, the less trouble that thou canst cause!"
"With this, I will finish it shortly. Wait here whilst I tend to the cage."
"Ahem, once I have gotten back to Moonshade I will be glad to oblige thee."
"I am Markus the trainer."
"It sits crouching in the shadow of the palace. But 'tis what controls the palace, if'n thou knowest what I mean."
"There is nothing evil in our principles! They are meant for all, without regard for station of birth."
"That's just fine. I was getting tired of you anyway."
"Thou wilt find no better rates..."
"What is thy business?"
"Where is the justice in the world when a strange mage comes to destroy our Temple and disrupt our peace?! Where is the keeper of the key?"
"My name is James."
"Hmph! I suppose that it would be beyond thy comprehension, anyway."
"The dairy is south of the shelter. Andrew -- the man who runs the dairy -- his father was friends with my father."
"To tell you to ask Miranda about it, for she knows more than I."
"Then why didst thou come here?!"
"Why Gustacio wants Mortegro's help, I'll never know. Unless the dead are responsible for the storms, or something."
"Without looking into the jewelry box, how many earrings would the noblewoman have to take out of the jewelry box to insure a matched pair?"
"Harrumph! Perhaps when thou hast found a bit of courage!"
Garritt does not meet your eyes. You instinctively know he is not telling the truth and may very well be using the venom.
"To have not enough gold for that!"
"Wouldst thou like something else?"
"Only Lord Marsten can approve one for a Tattoo of Valor. They are won for great deeds done on the field of battle."
"Yes, master..."
"How many dost thou want?"
We hope that thou dost enjoy thy stay at our establishment...
"I skin the carcasses myself."
The gargoyle gives you a menacing glare. Judging by his size, he would make a formidable foe.
"Which circle art thou interested in?"
"To be a group of spiritual seekers striving to reach the highest levels of gargoyle potential. To share with all gargoyles and humans."
"I can give thee 2 filari for every 1 gold coin thou hast."
"Want to help?"
"He came through town with a strange daemon creature as his companion and servant, and he had some sort of artifact in his possession."
"Yet they will never know the thrill of having a fine pot shape itself under their hand from a formless piece of mud..."
"Take the wind out of this egotistical dog's sails, Avatar!"
"Then be gone with thee -- I have no time to play games."
"No one would sell... Who knows, perhaps he hoped to make some sort of deal with the Mad Mage for them."
"It happened at the sawmill in Minoc."
"Thou wert wise to pick up that bedroll. Now we can sleep well anywhere."
"Curse thee! I shall roast thine flesh!"
"Thou canst purchase that from Gargan the Shipwright."
You see a filthy beggar who flashes you a grin as though you were his best friend in the whole world.
"The goblins have been nothing but trouble of late. Thou shouldst remain within the city gates."
"Thou dost not have enough gold for that!"
"I thought so! I have seen thy portrait before. And I had heard that thou wouldst be visiting! I'm Nell."
"Hmpf! If thou didst bet against him, then I suppose thou shalt be rich! I wouldst bet that thou wert the one who killed him, too!"
"My name is Coop."
"Although I do not know thee, I am certain that thou knowest me!"
"Death whispers most sweetly, but my soul is not allowed to respond. I do not desire to persist in this life."
"Although I spent quite a bit of time within Moonshade, I heard nothing about such a spell."
"'Tis a pinecone! I don't know where they come from, but Captain Hawk gave me one once. May I have this one, too?"
"I do not think he dares go against the wishes of the other two Captains."
"The Mages of Old Sosaria labored for nearly a year before the task was done. The revealed wonder was the Oracle."
"I shall make thee bleed!"
"...Er, Pikemen. Sorry, Argus."
"A girl cannot compete with that."
A sneering man watches as you approach. His eyes shift back and forth suspiciously.
"Failure in Brendan2Usable(_Action) because we couldn't find the guard that is supposedly pathfinding to the door."
"Why, he can't even out riddle a goblin!"
"His mission here is finished. He may now depart for the Void."
"As thou dost have something I want, then I am obliged to provide something to thee that thou couldst want."
"Thou art a fine person!"
"The voice came to me in a dream ~'Twas mine 'inner' voice, so fair. ~I now have a companion and provider, ~And a master about whom I care."
"Thou wouldst do better to ask Karenna. She is a good friend of the gypsies and would know more about them than I."
"Thou hast not seen the storms hit, and watched as something vanished before thy very eyes?"
"I am proud of thee! Thy life and thy deeds are all the testament anyone truly needs, provided one hath truly made something of their life."
"Death for the greedy. Death for any who steal from the dwellers in the caves."
"It is rare to find a stranger who is so well-mannered! I do hope that thou didst enjoy the egg I gave to thee!"
"Oh. As thou canst tell, mine hearing is not what it once was. 'Tis the roar of the fires which hath done it..."
"Return ta washin' the glasses, Jendon! Thou art no judge of what a warrior wishes ta hear."
"I did not think thou didst have any money!"
"It is the club of fighters run by Master De Snel! Second home to the fiercest and most ruthless fighters in all of Britannia."
"For those with an adventurous spirit, I can tell thee of the northern savages."
"Thou dost drive a hard bargain, indeed. But I must accept in order to be able to continue drinking..."
"Little slip of a woman. She's usually at her greenhouse or at the healer's hall."
"See? I told thee!"
"The Goblins shall no more steal our secrets, eh!"
"As thou wishest. I shall proclaim the verdict which I was previously instructed to give."
"The transaction is done!"
"Fool! Dost thou think thou canst actually kill me?" *"I am forever!" *"I am eternity!"
"But wait! I proceed too quickly. Perhaps thou art not the promised Hero... I must test thee, lest I give mine assistance in error."
"A blue aig?" ~"
"What a strange rock... Not from around here. Wouldn't be much good for building or for ballast."
Sir Dupre stares at the Fellowship medallion around your neck for a long moment. "Thou must be joking," he snorts.
"You are travelling in the wrong direction, my friend!"
"If there is anything thou wouldst like, please say so! And, er, I shall give thee a discount if thou dost buy from me!"
"He is a fearless warrior, who cherishes any opportunity for combat. Beware of him."
"He is much better now!"
"Have no doubt that it will convulse as death draws near, even as a man."
"Thou canst not be faulted for not knowing their names. No doubt there are quite a number of Pikemen."
"I suppose I could give it to thee if thou art going to look for those who killed my Father!"
Day 41: Ice filling the horizon! Temperature hath dropped.
"Aimi is the only one I have met, but I know there are one or two others who make wine there."
"How darest thou defame the good lady Bucia, my good and dear friend!"
"But wait! Thou hast forgotten this..."
"Never mind, then."
"Most gratefully!"
"Follow me through the gate, Avatar! Thou wilt soon be home..."
"Well met, Avatar!"
"She can then make the stew for the banquet."
"Rabindrinath vents his anger by troubling the dreams of those who venture here."
"To ask who you are and why you are here."
"What spell wouldst thou like to buy?"
"To have been a fine young gargoyle. The pride of us all. To wish to know who was responsible for his dishonorable end."
"I cannot help but think that this strange bottle must be a clue as to the identity of Monitor's traitor."
" Yurel loves cheese."
"Puny mortal!"
"Yes, master..."
"Wonderful dish. Try it!"
"There are two buttons on the posts behind me."
"What a puzzling mystery! Thou shouldst ask Renfry, our undertaker, about it."
"Lastly, there is a note, but its contents are not known to me."
"His dwelling place lies far southwest of here, in a grove of silverleaf trees. Perhaps he shall deign to aid thee."
"Mine husband is the most honorable man I have ever met in my life."
"Use caution, but I fear that thou wilt have to scour these areas in search of the orbs thou dost seek."
"Thou dost not remember me? I am Sentri! We have gone adventuring together in the past!"
"There is no traitor in Monitor. Search thou not for evidence, for thou shalt not find it. Instead, help us to eradicate the Goblins!"
"Spektor played a key part in Lord Marsten's plan to destroy the Bears and Wolves, so that the Leopards could rule Monitor!"
"Ah, but thou art so shy! Perhaps I can encourage thee to join me, by use of a little spell..."
"I never figured that Jendon would be listenin' ta my tales! It sounds just like them cats on that island..."
"Perhaps something more needs to be done."
"What? Oh, really! Thou dost think this Avatar looks like the real thing? I doubt it, Lucinda. I doubt it very much."
"Another time, then."
"Out! OUT! Take thyself from my sight and never return!"
"I strive to emulate him, in mine own humble way."
"I will pay thee 30 gold coins per gem. Is that price agreeable?"
"Well, no one else in town is spending coins, so I must reluctantly accept thine offer."
"I am obviously the most honest person in Britain! Perhaps I should move to Moonglow! Ha!"
"Forgive me. I have no questions for thee."
"I would still be grateful for thy protection."
"Very well. Dost thou promise to return my notebook?"
"I have not been down there in many years. Has something happened there?"
"Your statement is a mystery. For me to talk to wisps is what you want?"
"Avatar, do not trust him!"
"I used it to record mine experiments with blackrock and the blackrock transmuter."
"Anyway, I had spent weeks searching and was about to give up the search when, quite by accident, I wandered into this cavern."
"So! Simon told thee I had it. It is mine and I will keep it!"
You see a scruffy young man who is obviously suffering from a broken heart.
"If thou art not a Knight, then thou art nothing!"
"Thy companions carry some of thine inventory."
"Oh. Then I cannot give thee a key."
Abandon me.
"I became confused when trying to return to the pillars. And here I am... With all these lovely people."
"Forgive the interruption, Captain Voldin."
"M-M-Morz."
"And I shall obtain for thee an audience with the MageLord, have no fear! I am as good as my promise."
"Whilst making his observations of the storm, the Necromancer was struck by lightning -- and disappeared."
"Gargoyles in The Fellowship."
"Thou dost not have the gold for that!"
"Doth Shamino not have the passions of a normal man, Jendon?"
"Thou dost lie! I see no letter!"
"I am sorry. I should refer to the keep as the Serpent's Fang, but I think of it as DeathWatch... even so."
"If that is what thou dost wish..."
"Ah, yes, Moonglow. It is a pleasant town. It is possible to find all sorts of people here."
"Trellek has been met by you?" She smiles proudly, and takes another step forward. "What was said by him?"
"I told him I am a simple merchant. I do not carry such luxuries. I directed him to Monitor. There is a sculptor there."
"Until my father disappeared six months ago, I was a Captain in the Monitor Wolf Command."
"I have not heard from the lady I love since mine exile, and I can find no one willing to carry her word of my continuing devotion."
"This time, I think thou art wrong, Spektor! What else didst thou see in the dungeon?"
"But, as of yet, none have proven themselves innocent... If thou takest my meaning."
"Continue to pry secrets from the townsfolk -- sometimes, a stranger can learn more than an old friend."
"Ha! Dost thou think that because thou art now a Mage, that thou art equal to me? I reject thine advances, mage."
"Obviously, she fears the truths of The Fellowship as much as she fears Pomdirgun."
"Pleasant dreams."
"He is not here, and shows no signs of keeping his word. Men!"
"Failure in BrendanUsable(_Pathfind2) because we failed in our pop of a path egg."
"I ask the questions here."
"No, I must decline thine offer. Though I have enjoyed thy companionship, I must return to Moonshade. I must bury my beloved Rocco."
"Thou hast not heard of Batlin? He was the founder of The Fellowship movement, in Britannia."
"I can temporarily restore thy body, but thou art suffering from an affliction that cannot easily be cured."
Strange baubles -- silver disks with jewels in the center.
"I cannot imagine where Batlin may be. He has never missed a Fellowship meeting!"
"I moved here to hunt, of course. The forest is full of game. I would not think of living anywhere else!"
"Perhaps I shall go live in a hut on the coast. That would be less stressful..."
"Forgive me. I have no questions for thee."
"I had heard thou were travelling in Britannia again, but it took mine own eyes to believe it! Welcome, Avatar!"
"I should have guessed that Batlin intended something shady when I saw those two!"
"Thou dost not know the password. I am sorry. The Mayor may give thee the proper password."
"I am sorry I cannot be of more help."
"Well, ye'll have to come to the shop when it is open."
"What dost thou care to exchange for monetari?"
"Is this the way the Avatar deals?"
"I don't believe I wish to tell thee."
"Actually, I have seen something like this before. It was about four years ago, in Britain."
"Art thou certain thou hast not cast a dweomer upon me? I usually do not lower my prices so."
"I do not know exactly where. We heard nothing for many years."
"Good. I do my job good!"
You see a content-looking bearded man, with deep-set laugh lines in his face and gentle eyes.
"To be called Ansikart."
"Here! I hope it strangles him!" He thrusts the amulet into your palm. "And I hope he bloody strangles thee, too!"
"What dost thou want? Leave me alone!"
"Those are The Fellowship's three basic principles: Strive for Unity, Trust thy Brother, and Worthiness Precedes Reward."
"Use the key to obtain the waters of Logic. Thou hast well earned that honor."
"I am so relieved! There is so much to be done here."
"Such items are very valuable here, felon. Thou mayest find the prices steep..."
"Oh. I thought thou wert curious. Never mind then."
"If events should change thy mind, contact me."
"I was a powerful enchantress, in my prime. Before I was cheated of my powers."
Day 54: Was forced to hang a brace of men who stole some food from the cook.
"I am glad thou didst find me. I'd have hated to have died out here alone..."
"That is right, I was dead when last we saw one another. However, the good monks found my body and returned life to me."
"With thine attitude, I understand why thou art here."
"Since thou art under my Command, I expect to know thee much better in the days to come."
"Thou wilt not be sorry!"
"Place thy bet on the green spot at the end of the lane which corresponds to the trough in which thy rat is running."
"Wonderful scholar. Very nice woman. Married to Effrem."
Some very old and worn slippers, such as might be worn in the privacy of one's home.
"Once there, I will take thy form, and thou wilt take mine, for a brief period of time. Hmmm..."
"To be unable to carry that much, human!"
"It is exceedingly rare for the Goblins to slay a Gwani, but when they do, their chieftain immediately lays claim to the carcass."
"Dost thou wish to buy some reagents?"
"I... I think it was a... a dragon!"
"I believe thou dost already have that spell."
If a maid did not blow up the bellows.
"I am Baiyanda, mate of Mwaerno and healer for Gwani people."
"To want how many sets of twelve?"
"I know little about them..."
"I will take care of this immediately!"
"Don't tell that I told thee, but I hear that Pothos is on a secret errand for the MageLord!"
"I thank thee for thine excellent help. Now that my work hath been completed, I have time to teach thee magic as I promised."
"But this is merely the skull of a common bear, such as are found on the mainland, most often along the westerly coast."
"Wouldst thou like something else?"
"Do not expect me to be so courteous to thee next time!"
"In a wink, in a word,~"I do greet thee, Milord."
"Spektor the treasurer is the expert on currency in the town of Monitor."
"Thou dost not know the password. Sorry. The Mayor can give thee the proper password."
"To be acceptable."
"If thou hast spoken to each of us and hast determined that one of us is guilty, accuse accordingly. But be not hasty in thy judgment."
"I can give thee 1 monetari for every 4 filari thou hast."
"I don't think that would be advisable."
"The town healer said something about Rowena sitting on a throne in the Dark Tower on the northwestern point."
"No! 'Twas a letter to my beloved Delphynia..."
"Exiled now. Hear he spends his time drinking away his sorrows on another island."
"To be without the practical experience required to train at this time."
"She is the waterbearer of the town. She carries water from the well of Humility to all the homes in town."
"But thou said thou wouldst sell the Stoneheart!"
"He hath but lately declared himself chief of all goblins."
"Welcome to the Castle of King Shamino, the Betrayer! Let me greet thee..."
"Then I shall tell thee! I am a member of The Fellowship!"
"I see now that Captain Voldin and his men did take advantage of me, through the deception called the Oracle."
"Quit thy complainin', Jendon. I'm the only reason anyone comes in here now, and thou knowest it! They come ta hear me tales..."
You see a young entertainer who beckons to you.
"I am terribly sorry for thee at this sensitive time. Grief is a natural emotion..."
"Another time..."
"I'm afraid he hath been drinking..."
"Who knows? Mayhaps he became angry at Mistress Devra and walked away."
"Father must make some profit!"
"These cursed wizard-storms have destroyed all of our ships. Olon is the only sailor left alive in the city."
"Thou shouldst ask Standarr the armourer about that."
"With the aid of Lady Yelinda, those ways shall be restored to Fawn. These are such glorious times..."
"I'm sorry... ~Thou hast heard all of my songs."
"Go! The monks have need of thee. My daughter hath need of thee!"
"Why thou knowest that?"
"He said that anyone who can survive Freedom is worthy of his time!"
"The coins are thine!"
"As thou canst see... I am a Knight of Monitor."
"I see that thou has one gem."
"Return when we be open, and I will sell thee a meal!"
"We are on the trail of our father's murderer."
"Myauri Master Hunter of Gwani. He know where game are and how to find. But Mwaerno best at catching game. I very proud of him."
"What magic items wouldst thou care to buy?"
"She can sell thee many spells."
"I don't know what it was about. Perhaps thou shouldst ask Klog."
"Britain is such a grand city, but it can be somewhat disconcerting if thou dost not know anyone. Fortunately, I know many people here."
"But each year there have been fewer students, until now the school lies nearly empty."
"My, thou art impatient! I was just about to tell thee..."
"'Tis good to have more visitors again. We had despaired, what with the storms and all."
"'Tis such an incredible sight. Ho ho hee!"
"Well, as thou dost know, Brion is the head of Observatory, and Zelda, the advisor at the Lyceaum, is in love with him."
"Correct was my bonded-one. A whistle can be made by me."
"Perhaps they land to cache their booty in the forest. I have never followed them."
"To tell you the other is called Vesper. To be in the desert in northeastern Britannia. To have also humans living there, unlike here."
"To be done!"
"Our records are incomplete concerning the time of the resettlement. For that, thou shouldst see Fedabiblio in Moonshade."
"Information, weapons..." *"I bring back what I can... As long as there isn't too much wine!"
"I cannot join thee, friend. Even if thou wouldst cheat at the Test, I cannot aid thee in so doing. I am thy true friend."
"Thou must return the Heart of Elerion to me! I need it to restore balance to the forest and its creatures."
"How strange -- a bottle in the woods? Perhaps Templar can help thee. He is the expert on Goblins and their habits."
"I am a healer. I have chosen to set up shop here near the forest."
"Until Batlin interfered, this land had no Balance, but complete chaos was held in check... Until he loosed the Banes."
"Scots is the geographer. Spends all his time working on his new map of the continent."
"Leave! I have no wish to be seen with thee! Thou dost consort with criminals and blasphemers."
"To be very good. To know Teregus will be pleased to learn that, as well!"
"Perhaps another time then..."
"Such old, ratty things! Must have belonged to some Mundane -- no Mage would wear anything so worn."
"Did I not give thee the key to my storeroom? If thou canst not find it, thou art not as intelligent as I thought thou to be!"
"Yes, in truth it hath always been so, and shall always be. My natural good looks must be the result of my good breeding."
"I am certain I could also teach thy friend a thing or two..."
"Batlin seemed very interested in learning more of the history of the ancient people of this land -- the ones we call the Ophidians."
"To know all the gargoyles in Vesper. To want to know about specific ones?"
"It would appear thou dost not have enough monetari for that..."
"Certainly..."
"Peculiar, lord. Almost as if the man were hunting for something."
"I renounce any further questions! I thank thee, Delin. Thou mayest go."
"So I have been found out! Well, to the blazes with it all!!"
"'Tis good to see thee again, scholar of Order."
"The changes it has made in my personal life have helped me tremendously."
"He is the tavern keeper at the Hallowed Dock, just inside the Hold's doors. He is wonderful at remembering and discussing important facts."
"Now look within. Dost thou see the ashes which fill this urn?"
"Thy friend -- the master of song and mirth -- must be found before thou dost venture on."
"I also tend the bar for Phearcy in the evenings."
"'Tis not such an indecent offer." ~"I accept."
"Thou cannot possibly carry that much!"
"I shall be happy to show thee my ways of the world during normal business hours at my residence -- afternoons and evenings."
"Surely thou dost jest!"
"Please, I beg of thee to reconsider."
"To be named `Silamo.'"
"Thou have not made enough bread to be worthy of any payment at all."
"The values of the Ophidians are called the Teachings. Got it?"
"Ye've not got the gold. I kinna do business like that!"
"The other one is a troll. 'E don't talk much, but 'e's the first troll prisoner I have ever seen."
"Although I am called a peddler, I have the greatest selection of items to be found in New Magincia."
"We are by far the strongest of the three commands. The envy of the Serpent Isle."
"However, he doth not receive visitors, so do not dream of entering his palace."
"This calls for a toast. Hail to Beauty!"
"Thou dost show an unusual interest in this man. Speak to Lord Marsten. I shall say no more to thee about the matter."
"Make no untoward moves, I warn thee, for I am Elissa, Order Mage of the First Rank."
"This is very valuable information, friend."
"I do not know what else they hid there, but Spektor said that they had the power to someday rule all of Serpent Isle!"
"Very good! Let me see how many sacks thou dost have..."
The shrines are meant for the use of an Avatar only, and therefore a talisman will be necessary to use one.
"One of Monitor's famed Pikemen! I am Kylista, Priestess of Beauty."
"They and their passengers arrived shortly before the storms began."
The large, muscle-bound man smiles pleasantly at you.
"You are thanked."
"My name is Gustacio, if thou must inquire!"
"Ever since Filbercio replaced Rotoluncia as his playmate, Rotoluncia hath had to find some other interest to occupy her time."
"I also have an old spittoon. It was once used by... a great many people. Thou mayest have it for a gold piece. Take it! Please!"
"To be Betra, the provisioner. To feel confident he will join soon."
"I am honored to meet thee. I have always valued the brave Pikemen that guard our roads."
"Thou hast forgotten something."
"I do the bookkeeping at the Fellowship Branch. I work with mine husband, Klog."
"The wizard Gustacio hath agreed to aid us, if we will but assist him in his experiments."
"Speaking of that, I would like to discuss Brion."
"Once we find the Body Transferance Chamber, I will oblige thee."
"Long have Gwani been led by my wisdom, and hunting skills of mate Myauri. Together we are heart and soul of Gwani people."
"I am Anarchy! Hahaha!"
"All I know is that suddenly we have people running through the streets trying to escape whatever the Mage was attempting to conjure..."
"My mistress commands many powerful and strange magics, and sits upon the Council of Mages."
"If I have all these things, can I not say that I, too, have a soul?"
"I am the owner and manager of The Emerald."
"When I turn fifteen, I can take the Test of Knighthood and become a grand warrior!"
"Now that the foul mage Rabindrinath is dead, we have some hope of escaping his evil spell."
"Ask me something else..."
"Thou sayest it is not thine? Hmmm... Then thou wilt have to enquire in Moonshade to find who it belongs to."
"We have none so fancy here -- Only the ones that Alyssand makes."
"Such is the story of my life... Then I shall remain here, within this fetid swamp -- where I belong!"
"Alas, I must give thee bitter news! Before thou canst restore Balance, thou must reunite the Chaos Serpent."
"We have no city gates to hide behind."
"Those of us who do not cast magic are a small and disrespected part of society here. Whom dost thou desire to know about?"
"I can give thee 200 monetari for every gold bar thou hast."
"Please make up thy mind!"
"Perhaps in the darkness, thou didst become disoriented and imagine such an enemy."
You tell Charles what Jeanette said.
"Thou dost bargain well, my friend."
"I shall do all that I can to aid thee in restoring him. Or gladly care for him all the remainder of my days... even as he is."
"Here it is."
"'Tis always a pleasure to see another Britannian at Fawn, Avatar. How may I serve thee today?"
"Strangers are always welcome in Moonshade. My name is Bucia -- if thou needest help, thou hast merely to ask."
"Perhaps his cartography would be of aid to thee."
You see a handsome craftsman with an intense, piercing gaze.
"The Talismans of Principle must be placed upon the Dark Core like wedges in a pie."
"That sounds as if it may be some sort of instrument of mages. They may know of such things in Moonshade, but not here I fear."
"Is there anything else I can help thee with?"
"Thus thou hast proven thyself worthy of joining an elite band of warriors."
"When I am in my shop, bring me the body which thou didst obtain at Knight's Test."
He hands you a whip.
"Thou dost not have enough gold for that!"
"He is a good man but thou mayest not wish to stand too close to him. Thou mayest catch something."
"Thou art really interested in hearing more?"
"Dost thou care for something else?"
"Why raise the dead for servants when thou hast Mundanes for servants, after all? And we have no need of another Vasculio, that is clear."
"It matters not if any others venture with thee, but through this portal the four must pass!"
"Of course, I do wish for thee to return my venom to me if thou hast recovered it."
"He is my brother... and my friend. We protected the... Shrines together. We cannot let him... stay like that. Help me... assist him."
"Nice cap. A bit small, though. Not something a fisherman would wear... It would blow off the ship."
"But what of our agreement?"
"Why, thou art the confidant of the accused blasphemer! I cannot be seen speaking with thee..."
"And it doth not seem right having a woman as a healer. Women should concern themselves with the delights of life, not the sorrows."
"Suit thyself."
"There is nothing thou canst do -- all is done for, all is lost!"
"What didst thou find at the murder site?"
"Stop thy whining, Vasel! Back to work with thee!"
"I have not yet spoken with any of them Mages. I'll admit that they frighten me..."
"To have been put here by the humans. To be permitted to leave, and also to reside elsewhere, but to know that many humans do not like us."
"In fact, I am taking bets on the upcoming duels. Dost thou wish to bet that Sprellic will lose to any of the three other duellists?"
"Perhaps I could find another song for thee..."
"Oh, I know nothing of such frills. But Brendann would be well familiar with how to remove them from a woman."
"See! I told everyone that I could not be the traitor!"
"My biggest lines are:~~"Name!"~~"Job!"~~"Bye!"
"Yes, Master, shovels too. Pitchers and other containers. Cloth and a few weapons. We also sell baked goods."
"A pity. Private instruction is available."
"To ask you to please come back when my shop is open."
You share a friendly laugh at your reunion.
"Why, they are an extremely helpful group. Their branch office is just east of mine. Very optimistic group of people."
"The Broken Oar is a tavern. It is the only establishment in Fawn that offers rooms to rent." *"Most strangers stay there."
"I help my brother tend our farm here in Moonglow."
"Thou shouldst report such a crime as this to Julia. She can aid thee."
"I do believe in Daemons. There is much evil in this world, and I do not believe that we cause it of ourselves."
"We must plan for every eventuality, Avatar. Should I not be able to remain here, I shall await thee on Monk Isle."
"Behold the mystery of Balance! When Order struck down the Serpent of Chaos, the act undid the tapestry of Balance."
"Thou dost not work for the Magister, dost thou?"
"No, no, no -- thou shouldst learn of the password first! Thou dost need it most of all, for Erstam shall not speak with thee without it!"
"The other... as thou knowest, was Ruggs."
"Perhaps his maps will aid thee, though they are not as accurate as he wishes."
"Dost thou give me thy promise?"
The day passed rather rapidly, uneventfully.
"There's this island... Can't at all remember where it is. No one lives there, though. A barren, uninviting place..."
"While I myself have seen no such locket, perhaps thou shouldst ask Master Robin about it."
"What wouldst thou like to buy?"
"Show me thine items, I will tell thee what I know, if anything."
"To be known as Quaeven, human."
"Yet it is as nothing compared to the greater swindles which she practices. She doth conspire against Nature itself, didst thou know?"
"Thou still goest the wrong way. I'm leaving!"
"As it is, they have nearly brought disaster upon us all... including thee, Hero from Another World."
"Seek the Horn... the Gwani Horn... seek it in the depths beneath the Skullcrusher Mountains."
"Our establishment is now closed. Please come by during business hours."
"To be known as Kallibrus."
"I do believe thou dost have too many members travelling in thy group. I shall wait until someone leaves and thou dost ask me again."
"The slaughterhouse is run by Morfin, the merchant. He is always busy, coming and going at all hours, sometimes carrying things."
"Fascinating. This key refuses to be added to the key ring."
"My spirit hath lingered here, for my final duties remain unfinished..."
"To be a great mind, knowledgeable in many things."
"Thou shouldst say cowardly cur, instead!"
"If I were thee, I would avoid his domain... Although, I have heard that the liche possesses two fabulous treasures."
"I shall act as a channel for the power to restore thy group as it should be."
"If thou dost want anything to eat or drink, just say so!"
"Delphynia is an herbalist."
"These were not the voices of anyone I have ever known. But still these voices had a profound effect on me..."
"Then why'dst thou ask in the first place?"
"He is doing fine now that he's not a parrot any more. Though he says that he hath been having bad dreams of late. I do not blame him."
Things unsavory may often be necessary. All Causes are not what they seem. What appears evil often can be good. Never discount.
"I am truly sorry, but I can only operate these doors. I know nothing about any other doors in this place."
"Terrible threat to Gwani people ended thanks to thou! We grateful!"
Gargan coughs.
"I am not certain that I'll know anything useful, but in what art thou interested?"
"Go quickly! See if she is there, and if so, flush her out!"
"There is no doubt that Daemon British exists. I have seen the records left by previous generations."
You see the gargoyle clerk taking notes in the corner.
"The rules are few..." *"Thou shalt face ten Worms. Thou canst not leave until the last Worm hath been dispatched."
"Mine own Orb of the Moons exploded recently! To no longer be able to travel via Moongates. To be strange!"
"A happy thought, no?"
"I should retire from magery. I am losing mine edge."
You see a gleeful-looking merchant with an enthusiastic voice and manner.
"Thou dost speak in error, friend. Remember, thou hast a customer in Monitor..."
"There are few who can match me! The secret is to be in control. A Knight who doth lose his temper in battle is a defeated Knight."
"While searching for the pass he came upon three mystics who were standing alongside the trail."
"For the past veek I have been avay from home doing vork for The Fellowship."
"Mine interest lies with dead beings, not with living persons. I do not have thy friend, nor do I know who doth have him."
"It was Columna who stole him from my love, by using her magics on him. Yet she never loved him... he was simply a toy to her."
"Thou dost not speak to an ordinary Pikeman!" *"This is the Avatar!"
"Now don't go tellin' me that thou beest a Pikeman like those ugly sons out in the tower."
"No... The banes, they have... Oh, what have I done!"
"Flessar was a Knight of the Leopard Command. He was Templar's friend."
"How many suits of plate armour wouldst thou care to sell?"
"Is there anything else I can help thee with?"
"Avatar, you are not welcome here!"
"The service is quicker and much friendlier."
"Well, that foolish leader of the Leopards is now dead. I wonder who will replace him?"
"If any one person could be considered the heart of Moonshade, I'd be hard-pressed to say whether it was Bucia or Rocco."
"Forgive me, but this is an absolute waste of time, when there are other matters which are pressing..."
"I have many of thy belongings in my possession. Dost thou want them returned?"
"Come back when thou art ready to be a man!"
"Then the Hound can guide thee to the general vicinity where the sought being doth dwell. Nothing can stop the beast."
He gives you a long puzzled look. After a moment he takes one of his loaves of bread and swats you over the head with it.
"Luther is the worst. Oh, how I hate him!"
"I do not care what Feridwyn says! My son is no thief!"
"I am not looking forward to sailing again, I can tell thee."
This flamboyant bard exudes a festive aura.
"This land was deserted then, settled only by Goblins and covered with the ruins of a mysterious ancient Serpentine civilization."
"The Great Captains deal with them for me."
"Thou dost not have enough money."
"Thou must needs take the bird Ale to the tower in the wilderness, and place him where the lightning can strike him."
Thou shalt read The Books aloud.
"I must be about my duties. We must discuss this another time."
"My fee will leave thee with nothing!"
"To mean `strong one.'"
"I do not give my merchandise away!"
"All my friends call me Bennie."
You see a very serious young man. He carries himself like a learned and mannered gentleman.
"Afraid? Why, the Avatar is not afraid of magic."
"What is thine?"
"Then thou canst not stay at the inn. In these hard times, I cannot afford to keep thee and thy companions for free."
"Pomdirgun is the epitome of all repulsive things. He hath risen to unite the goblins against all things good and Beautiful."
"Oh? Do I?"
"Gwenno said thou help people in need. Thou must find some Ice Dragon blood for Neyobi! It is the last hope!"
I'd be an egg and lie under their breasts.
"One day I shall be Lord of the Bears, when Caladin is at last seen for the pathetic coward that he truly is."
"For a gold coin I will tell thee another. Dost thou wish to hear it?"
"She teaches close-quarter combat. Everything I needed to know to survive on my journeys I learned from her."
"Thou dost not have enough money."
"Oh, thank thee, kind monk!"
"I am Daphne."
"The Chaos Serpent was far too generous in granting him a full year. Had it granted him but a month, I would already have saved the world!"
"Our prices are fair here at the Blue Boar, eh?"
"Thou art carrying too much to take thy deed. Come back after putting some things down."
"Ah-- but thou dost know all of this."
"Excellent! Then wait until the life-creating reaction begins! But I warn thee, it may be dangerous. I am staying here."
"Only from time to time hath one caught mine eye... Like that striking young woman that came through here a while ago."
"Something hath sorely affected her, for I do not believe that she could be so disturbed otherwise."
"But that is before thou didst come here! Thou must save me from this devil Draygan!"
"Wouldst thou like another spell?"
"The only other thing I ever heard from those mages that made sense is that a dragon is very hostile if its mate or young is killed."
"I had almost tired of waiting for thee, Avatar. Thou'rt some hero... it took thee long enough."
"Hast thou reconsidered my request, Avatar? Wilt thou give to me the Dream Crystal?"
"'Tis an honor to meet thee, Avatar."
"Hmmm. I suppose I can tolerate thy presence for a few moments."
"Even strangers like thyself are welcome to spar. 'Tis good preparation for the Test of Knighthood."
"Chancellor Zulith deals with them for me."
"Here is the key to thy friend's jail cell. Set him free."
"To know that only gargoyles are strong enough to pull the levers!"
"I doubt but thou deceivest me further. If true, thou dost shame the title. Admit now thy true name!"
"How many wouldst thou like?"
"Wouldst thou be willing to aid us in liberating this city from false traditions and evil schemes?"
"Well, there is Mortegro -- his speciality is dead things, spirits, and burial rites. Not a pleasant fellow."
"We have captured the falsehearted traitor, Lady Yelinda! Kylista is in chains, and Great Captain Voldin hath been found dead..."
"Cellia here in town is a tanner and a furrier. This hat looks like it could be her work."
"Surely it would not hurt to tarry for a bit..."
"Oh, well... Another time, perhaps."
"Oh, do not be coy with me, Avatar. Thou dost know very well the purpose of a unicorn. ~~We are foolproof virgin detectors!"
"Congratulations on having passed the Test of Knighthood! I greet thee as almost a brother."
"It is located just behind the court. And," he grins, "I am proud to say that is at least one thing about which I know nothing."
"The Sorceress Rotoluncia is the heart of dissension. She is ambitious beyond measure, and causes all manner of trouble."
"Alas, it did me little good in the end..."
"How many wouldst thou like?"
"Now is the time for the young and the old to dig in their pockets and give up the gold. * Dost thou wish to donate a gold piece?"
"They shall be thine oldest and most trusted friends, and it is their part to share thine adventure with thee."
"I waited a week or so before I sent word to Wilfred and Argus about their father not returning."
"Surely thou knowest of what I speak? Meditation, silence, aesthetics, ascetics, and so forth."
"Presently, I am the mayor of Jhelom."
"To mean `strong arm' in the language of the gargoyles."
"What a nice son! He compliments me so!"
"Nor would I like ta... Thou art enough ta scare a man half ta death!"
"Don't believe I've met the man before."
"I think thou hast talked me into a price that is too low..."
"To be the gardener who lives to the east of the mountains."
Day 45: Strange how ice magnifies all.
"I cannot still believe that Marsten would betray the entire city to the Goblins. Still, thine evidence is most convincing..."
"Ask me again tomorrow. I promise thee that I can accomplish this thing, but not instantly, not immediately."
"My job is to provide counsel for Lord John-Paul and anyone else in need of guidance here at the Hold."
"So be it."
"Long ago, the Order Hierophant bound a force of great evil into a prison and placed it here for us to guard."
De Snel peers at you, obviously aware you are lying.
"I may have already mentioned Owen, the shipwright. He builds the finest ships that have ever set sail."
"Well! Thy reputation precedes thee! The Avatar in person! Word has spread that thou wert in Britain!"
"I see! And the urn which thou didst return to Caladin -- it was exchanged for thy friend!"
"I am Ducio, the Master Artisan."
"In fact, I was wondering if thou couldst use someone like me to accompany thee in thy travels and adventures."
Listen to silence and it will speak to thee.
Into thy boots the foul concoction will seep, bringing on nausea and dizziness. The wise traveller wears swamp boots in such places.
"We shall speak of this after thou hast helped me with mine experiment."
"I cannot live with the shame of the deaths I have caused... If I can redeem myself by becoming the required martyr, so be it!"
"Here is thy room key. It is good only until thou dost leave."
"Thou dost not have any gems to sell!"
"Thou wishest to make a purchase. Excellent. But remember, a gold piece saved is a gold piece not spent."
"He is a fellow monk. He spends his time studying the plants, animals, and geography of Britannia."
"I am the greatest fighter in Monitor! But I sense that thou art uncertain. Dost thou disagree?"
"To prove his prowess, he torments the weakest Knights and challenges them to meet him on the List Field."
"This is not thine usual love story, no. This here's about dragons, ice dragons."
"Thou cannot possibly carry that much!"
"It appears thou dost not have any money either!"
"But my preferences run to the bow. An ancient weapon, and elegant, a fine bow of Yew may bring down game sooner than a sword."
"How many sets of twelve wouldst thou like?"
"The Avatar! This is a strange chance. Tell me Avatar, by what name art thou called?"
"I work during the day and evening hours. Thou shouldst come by the pub then and we shall talk more!"
"Oh... They are fine things, not what thou wouldst find among the women of fisher-folk."
"I saw several like this in empty goblin campsites when we tried to route the goblins from this area."
"Ah, then thou dost agree it is the sweetest, dost thou not?"
"Kylista refused us the safety of the city walls, even when the tower fell to the barbaric goblins."
"I am so grateful that thou hast taken on the quest of saving my daughter. If I can help thee, ask."
"Who made thee a teacher, apprentice?! Back to work!"
"Erstam was the mentor of most of the Adepts. He was a hard master, so they say."
"Julia of the Rangers might be of aid to thee, but I doubt it. This matter concerns magic, and she is merely Mundane."
"Ah, one of thy companions hath been slain. 'Tis within my power to heal thy friend if thou dost wish..."
"I am sorry to see that thou art not trusting enough to reveal thy name." He shrugs. "By the by, thy voice crackles too much."
"If anyone is the spy, it must be Krayg. He is often out in the woods, alone -- and he never brings back booty or prisoners."
"Oh. Thou hast heard it before."
"It like to broke his heart when Wilfred ran away to Monitor. That's where the @Lord@ Wilfred hies from..."
"'Tis no time for idle chatter! There have been two people murdered over at William's sawmill!"
