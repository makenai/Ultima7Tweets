The orb appeared again in the hands of authorities in Thiriastith, who siezed it from a suspected stolen goods fence.  Not knowing its import, the authorities auctioned it as a bauble to a wizard who knew what the orb was.  This wizard, who was known only as the Asp, aspired to steal the silver seed.  He came to Serpent's Fang as an adventure seeker and was told that the other orbs were stolen or lost.  He discerned their whereabouts from this information, but that which he was told was apparently not true, for he set out immediately for Aram-Dol's lair.

		UcMessage("  As thou hast already been told, we had found a means by which the minds of our finest warriors and the bodies of snakes could be fused with one another. The resulting warrior would wreak terrible havoc on the forces of Order, bringing them their well-deserved destruction. In the earliest stages of the experiment all was well; we succeeded in joining Adder with Man in five of seven volunteers. The resulting form was vaguely humanoid, with resilient green skin, tough as the scales of a serpent.*");
		UcMessage("  We found that the soldiers' minds were very much unchanged, and coupled with the quickness and sensitivity to smell of the adder, the Shasrajah were formidable in battle. Their long necks had tremendous reach, and they preferred to attack solely with their strong jaws. We were encouraged by this success, and accepted eighty-three more warriors to undergo the metamorphosis. All was well, as seventy-one survived. We believed we had found a counter to the automaton warriors the forces of Order had reputedly developed.~");
		UcMessage("  Much to our chagrin, however, our experiment went awry shortly thereafter. As we had them do battle to assess their powers, we noticed a disturbing trait -- the warrior would become more bloodthirsty and uncontrollable with each triumph! Soon they began to rebel against our commands. We had no choice but to exterminate them and begin anew, but the five hundred soldiers we sent against our own creations -- our monsters -- were unable to best them. We surrendered the area to them, enclosing them with stout doors in the corridors leading out.*");

Though automatons have made these nothing more than curiosities, some functional units are still in use today (e.g. the Fiend's Domain, but I implore you not to go exploring just to see one) The animated suits of armor have picked up many knicknames, such as \"Suits,\" \"Brass-brains,\" \"Dummies,\" etc.  They are severely limited in capability, able to understand but a few words, and even then are more than likely to forget orders more than three words in length.  They were used primarily as guards, for they could take more damage than a human guard and were replaced easier if slain than a man would be.*");
		UcMessage("	The next achievement, representing a significant leap in servant design, was the \"Brass Automaton.\"  These are still used (particularly by frontier outposts such as Serpent's Fang) because they are far more intelligent than animated suits of armor and less costly to create than iron automatons (see next page).  Their main drawback is that, like the animated suits of armor, they cannot be re-used once they are slain.*");
		UcMessage("	Most commonly used are the \"Iron Automatons.\"  Since they are considered the standard servant in our time, they are referred to simply as automatons. Iron automatons are slightly stronger, quicker, and more resilient than brass automatons as well as slightly more intelligent.  The greatest advantage, however, is that if an iron automaton is slain, it can be reactivated. The spell used, Create Automaton, is found in nearly every wizard's spellbook. These advantages do not come free, however; they are more costly to initially create and drain more mana and reagents than the lesser servants.*");

		UcMessage("\"But beware of the automatons!\"");
		UcMessage("\"The last I knew, before I earned the Anarch's ire, Stefano was alive... though he was being pursued by some fell creature.\"");
		UcMessage("\"Ducio yet lived. As did Torrissio. And I can only pray that Andrio and Freli escaped the notice of that monster!\"");
		UcMessage("\"Thou dost not know what a Magister does? The Magister is the director of the Seminarium -- 'tis the only School for Mages in the entire land.\"");
		UcMessage("\"One of my functions is to find gifted children for this school. When they are located, I bring them to the school.\"");
		UcMessage("\"I was appointed as Magister for life.\"");
		UcMessage("\"A young, untrained Mage can be quite dangerous! Therefore, these children must be brought to the Seminarium -- for their own safety!\"");
		UcMessage("\"For instance, take young Freli. His father was a shopkeeper. What could a merchant teach his son about magical powers!\"");
		UcMessage("\"Taking care of my students is a tiring but fulfilling duty. Young Freli shows much promise, and Andrio is almost ready to graduate.\"");
		UcMessage("\"The Seminarium is unique in all the land, for all Mages are welcome to come here and study our records concerning spell research and magical activity.\"");
		UcMessage("\"Any Mage can study here in safety, knowing that this place is a sanctuary from violence.\"");
		UcMessage("\"Passing travellers also stop here to access our library.\"");
		UcMessage("\"Andrio hath quite a bit of youthful enthusiasm, and I find that most refreshing, but I do wish that he would use a bit more caution in his experiments!\"");
		UcMessage("\"I must confess that Freli is my favorite student. He is most brilliant, but the unfortunate thing is that he knows this. Sometimes I feel that he is simply too smart for his own good.\"");
		UcMessage("\"Thou art not the first to be attracted to our facilities! In recent days, two visitors are memorable.\"");
		UcMessage("\"First, there was the scholar Gwenno. We could not help her much, as her interest was in historical matters. I suggested that she consult the library on Monk Isle.\"");
		UcMessage("\"Less agreeable was the visit of the Mage Batlin. He appeared to be most interested in the ancient inhabitants of this land, the Ophidians. Indeed, one might say that he was obsessed.\"");
		UcMessage("\"Since thou art a visitor, I will explain a few things to thee. Moonshade is a city of Mages and for Mages. It is ruled by the Adepts, and served by the lesser Mages. There is a lower class -- the Mundanes. But some of them are skilled as artisans.\"");
		UcMessage("\"The three Adepts are the most powerful wizards in the city. They compose the Council of Mages, which governs the city.\"");
		UcMessage("\"One of the Adepts serves as MageLord. Currently, Filbercio rules as Lord of Moonshade.\"");
		UcMessage("\"All is in an uproar, with Rotoluncia dead and her replacement -- the Necromancer Mortegro -- missing.\"");
		UcMessage("\"Gustacio hath asked that I join the Council in this troubled time, and I have done so.\"");
		UcMessage("\"Rotoluncia was on the Council, but her recent death hath made a change necessary. Therefore, Mortegro the Necromancer now holds her former position.\"");
		UcMessage("\"Gustacio remains on the Council, as he is second in power only to Filbercio.\"");
		UcMessage("\"The other two Adepts are Gustacio the Green Mage, and the Red Sorceress, Rotoluncia.\"");
		UcMessage("\"He comes from a long line of Mages. Filbercio is well-respected and is known as a shrewd administrator of city affairs. In private, though, it is said that he is something of a womanizer.\"");
		UcMessage("\"When dealing with magic in this city, everything in this city is political. And when dealing with politics, Filbercio is the master of the game. I dare say, he would be a force to be reckoned with, even if his actual magical skills alone were not good enough to make him the MageLord of Moonshade.\"");
		UcMessage("\"If Filbercio doth have a flaw, it is that he can be distracted by a pretty face. It doth not hurt if that face belongs to a woman who is also a powerful Mage. The trouble is that it doth not deter him if that woman is already betrothed to another! Oh, perhaps I have said too much...\"");
		UcMessage("\"He is Filbercio's chief rival for the position of MageLord. Gustacio is extremely hard-working and devout in his studies and practices of the magical arts. He is a respected citizen, although there are those who do not like him -- he tends to have a rather severe personality.\"");
		UcMessage("\"Now, Gustacio hath thrown himself into his studies of the phenomenon of the teleport storms. It hath become his obsession.\"");
		UcMessage("\"Trust me, she is someone thou dost not wish to cross.\"");
		UcMessage("\"Mortegro, master of death magic. Quite often he is dismissed as having the least political influence, but it is a mistake to underestimate him. He is a highly-skilled diplomat. After all, he hath remained on close personal speaking terms with the dead for all these years.\"");
		UcMessage("\"He holds seances regularly. I am certain he will invite thee to one, sooner or later.\"");
		UcMessage("\"Indeed, Mortegro hath gone missing! It is said that he chose to take a stroll during one of the magical storms...\"");
		UcMessage("\"Whilst making his observations of the storm, the Necromancer was struck by lightning -- and disappeared.\"");
		UcMessage("\"It would be a shame if he were dead, for only he knows the secrets of speaking with the souls of the dead.\"");
		UcMessage("\"These are citizens who have pursued some sort of magical education. Although they know a few spells, they were not able to become Adepts. Most become Rangers or Apothecaries.\"");
		UcMessage("\"These are basically Mundanes who possess some skill that is valued in the society of Mages. Artists, writers, musicians, metalsmiths... That sort.\"");
		UcMessage("\"These poor souls live in a dark little world where magic is merely another powerful natural force that affects them, which they desperately try to adjust to or withstand.\"");
		UcMessage("\"Most of the Mundanes born here eventually leave. They settle in Fawn or Monitor, and this is better for them.\"");
		UcMessage("\"In what art thou interested?\"");
		UcMessage("\"Thou hast mistaken me for a common gossip.\"");
		UcMessage("\"There are many strange places that one may explore in Moonshade. To the south of the city are ancient catacombs. Somewhere within those tunnels is a way leading to a dungeon known only as Furnace.\"");
		UcMessage("\"The catacombs were once occupied by the Rangers, until the water level began to rise. The Rangers built pumps to drain the water, but then a strange breed of rodent began to infest the catacombs. The creatures are said to be large vicious rats that have fangs as big as daggers. Needless to say, the catacombs were shortly abandoned.\"");
		UcMessage("\"I myself would not go there. It is said that the heat there is so intense that it is lethal.\"");
		UcMessage("\"Bucia the Shopkeeper hath sent thee to me! And what did she tell thee to ask of me?\"");
		UcMessage("\"Might I take that...\"");
		UcMessage("\"Yes, this is pumice -- black in color, rough in texture, light in weight.\"");
		UcMessage("\"Pumice is a light, rough rock of a black or light brown hue.\"");
		UcMessage("\"These rocks are formed when the Primal Forces of Fire and Earth collide -- during certain conjurations, for instance.\"");
		UcMessage("\"Pumice is also found deep in the bowels of the world, where fire runs liquid.\"");
		UcMessage("\"That item is used for researching the properties of magic, and to create new spells.\"");
		UcMessage("\"It is not safe for thee to have such an item. As the Magister, it is my duty to take that from thee.\"");
		UcMessage("\"It is not mine, but I cannot tell thee to whom it belongs. Only Master Ducio would know.\"");
		UcMessage("\"The item sounds as if it might be a piece of magical apparatus. Master Ducio would know for certain.\"");
		UcMessage("\"But thou shouldst not handle such equipment -- for Mundanes, it could be very dangerous.\"");
		UcMessage("\"Ah, yes. We sometimes find these on the beach after a storm.\"");
		UcMessage("\"The northern trees produce tough cones which are filled with seeds. Later, the cones open and release their seeds.\"");
		UcMessage("\"As thou canst see, this cone still doth have its seeds. It hath been newly released from its tree.\"");
		UcMessage("\"It must have come directly from the northern forests, on the mainland north of the Swamp of Gorlab.\"");
		UcMessage("\"Once the pinecone releases its seeds, it becomes a dried husk. Being light, it is transported by wind and wave.\"");

		UcMessage("\"What a stench! This egg hath gone putrid!\"");
		UcMessage("\"A blue egg... doth not seem to be magical or in any way arcane...\"");
		UcMessage("\"A blue egg... have I ever read of such a thing? Blue hens, blue frogs -- but eggs?\"");
		UcMessage("\"I do not know what it is! And if I do not know, then no one shall.\"");

		UcMessage("\"Remember always -- knowledge is power.\"");
		UcMessage("\"Thank thee for saving me. Now that I am no longer imprisoned within stone, I can continue my researches. There must be some way to stop Shamino the Anarch!\"");
		UcMessage("\"The ancient scroll? Be warned -- it is written entirely in the ancient runes of the Daemons who once dwelt in this land. I can understand none of it.\"");
		UcMessage("\"It is said that Erstam translated portions of it, but the translation was lost many years ago.\"");
		UcMessage("\"As a token of my gratitude, please accept this, the Scroll of the Serpent.\"");

		UcMessage("~Introduction~");
		UcMessage("	~Trusty and well-beloved adventurer, I greet thee well and thank thee for reading this short treatise.  Herein, combat tactics will be described for thy benefit in setting forth, dearest adventurer.");
		UcMessage("Thou wilt learn how to read a book and how to fight intelligently in our worlds.");
		UcMessage("	Thy safety is important for the worlds are vast enough for thee to roam freely about. Restless warrior, I know thou hast oft crisscrossed the land and oft the swamps, so think how easy a prey an injured man would be for the creatures who inhabit these realms.");
		UcMessage("~	The basic rule of safety in combat and in unknown territories is not to think of thyself as over-mighty. Thou mayest be witty and subtle in thy speech, but thou must be even more alert and aware of thy combat environment. Adapt to thine opponent, to the weather and to the terrain.*");
		UcMessage(" 	Know thyself, know thine opponent. Thou shalt know thy limits. Thou shalt identify as quickly as possible what kind of creature thou art faced with so that thou canst use the most appropriate strategy.");
		UcMessage("	For example, know that herbivores will flee quite oft.");
		UcMessage("On the other hand, carnivorous creatures attack the weakest opponent.");
		UcMessage("Some creatures will attack at random or toward the weakest party member.");
		UcMessage("Thou shouldst expect militiamen and guards to use tactically accurate strategies. The weakest member will be attacked, flanking will be used, as well as tactical retreats, and so forth...*");
		UcMessage("		Always use logic. Creatures from the Icy Lands will be more susceptible to fire, for example, and swamp creatures are immune to poison.");
		UcMessage("When attacking foes, a good strategy is easily available to thee: thou canst always hide and shoot. Or thou canst flank and protect thyself quite well. When flanking, it is best to use some long range type of habiliment. For example, a crossbow could be given to an ally who is flanking. Make sure the ally who is flanking does not hurt any of the other members in thy group. Caution is strongly advised.");
		UcMessage("		Use thine habiliment of war well. A bow always requires arrows. Ensure thou art not short of ammunition or wielding a useless weapon.");
		UcMessage("		Use thy surroundings to slow thine opponents. For example, thou mayest lay down caltrops on thine enemy's path.");
		UcMessage("		Most of all, always maintain a good balance between ranged and non-ranged habiliment of war within thy travelling group.*");
		UcMessage("		Upon leaving a town for thine adventures in the wilderness, do stop by the various shoppes to purchase a backpack and fill it with many a variety of foods. Long trips without food will leave thee weak and more susceptible to wounds from thine enemies' attacks. Thou shalt not bypass a trainer's hall. Thou shouldst train hard to become a better warrior. Visit trainers and learn from them. Those hours spent training with masters may save thy life.*");
		UcMessage("		While it is necessary to use armour wisely, I recommend to thee to buy armour as soon as possible. In doing so take into consideration the following qualities: weight, sturdiness, protection.");
		UcMessage("Armour may be divided into the two types appearing hereunder:");
		UcMessage("	- antique");
		UcMessage("	- magic");
		UcMessage("The magic armour type is almost twice as effective in protecting thee as the antique one.");
		UcMessage("Antique armour includes leather, metal scales, chain mail and metal plates. The sturdier the material, the greater the protection.");
		UcMessage("Leather armour, boots, collar, gloves and helm offer the least protection. On the other hand, they will be the lightest.");
		UcMessage("Scale armour and chain armour, chain coif and chain leggings are a bit better than leather, but not overmuch.*");
		UcMessage("Shields: a buckler or a wooden shield will provide thee with the least amount of protection in this category. A brass shield or a curved heater will provide thee with the most protection. By protection, thou shouldst understand that thine attacker will be deflected away from thee.");
		UcMessage("Amongst helms, thy choice is great and the best protection comes from the magic helm. The great helm is nearly as efficient, though. The crested helm and the caddelite helm do offer the same amount of safety.");
		UcMessage("Chain armour, chain coif, and chain leggings will decrease very little the impact of enemy blows. ");
		UcMessage("Thou wilt need a gorget and some greaves for those exposed vital areas. A kidney belt could be useful but, I must needs warn thee, of little protection.");
		UcMessage("Plate armour offers solid protection for thy money. I would recommend a pair of plate leggings as well.");
		UcMessage("The ultimate protection, in matters of armour, at this point in time, is as follows: a magic helm, a magic shield, a magic gorget, a pair of magic leggings and some magic gauntlets.*");
		UcMessage("		Dearest fighter, for thine ease I will divide weapons into groups. Thus, at one glance, thou mayest easily remember their efficiency. I will begin with the least damaging weapons:");
		UcMessage("	Blowguns, boomerangs, daggers, slings, pitchforks, picks and whips have very little effect.");
		UcMessage(" A magic axe, a mace, a morning star, a two-handed axe, a spear, a shovel or a sword are of limited effect upon thine opponent.");
		UcMessage(" A scythe, a bow, a fire sword, a musket, or a two handed hammer are slightly more damaging.");
		UcMessage(" Crossbows (my favorite), halberds, lightning whips, magic bows, fire wands and fire bolts are very powerful weapons.");
		UcMessage("Find the best weapon and armour thou canst obtain.");
		UcMessage("Remember all weapons ought to be kept ready for immediate use.");
		UcMessage("One more word of wisdom:");
		UcMessage("Do not neglect thy sleeping time. Sleeping frequently will give thee the rest fighters need. An eight hour sleep will restore full strength for thee and thine allies.*");
		UcMessage("	If thou hast weak allies, thou shouldst know the most suitable and productive method of combat is to prompt them to attack the weakest enemy or encourage them to flee. In order to protect a weak ally, thou shouldst bestow the protection halo on them. In addition to that, thou mayest put the strongest member in thy group in charge of protecting the weakest.");
		UcMessage("	When attacking foes, a good strategy is easily available to thee: thou canst always hide and shoot. Or thou canst flank and protect thyself quite well. When flanking, it is best to use long range type of habiliments, for example, a crossbow. Be sure the member of thy group who is flanking doth not hurt any of thine other allies. Caution is strongly advised.");
		UcMessage("	Thy band members armed with heavy weapons should be swift to attack the strongest opponent. Other members should follow thy guidance and attack the weakest enemies.");
		UcMessage("		When reading a book, look for useful information and memorize it or jot it down, for thou mayest have need of it later. Read quickly, but read all pages. I cannot emphasize enough the importance of reading all of the pages of a book.*");
		UcMessage("Conclusion");
		UcMessage("~	Dearest adventurer, I beseech thee to thoroughly consider the aforesaid cautions and advice.");
		UcMessage("The reason that I wrote such a treatise is to sharpen thy fighting skills, but thou canst tell that is not a goal in itself.");

It was then up to the leaders of the individual groups to decide who would next trod upon the unknown isle. Kosric and Pedigar claimed the right, as their group were the finest warriors among them.

They are: Strive For Unity, Trust Thy Brother, and Worthiness Precedes Reward. Strive For Unity basically means that people should cooperate and work together. Trust Thy Brother implies that we are all the same and that we should not hate or fear each other. Worthiness Precedes Reward suggests that we must each strive to be worthy of that which we want out of life.\"");
